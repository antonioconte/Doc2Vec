All these chemicals have been progressively banned or severely restricted at Community level by means of a series of regulatory actions, the latest of which is Commission Directive 1999/77/EC of 26 July 1999 adapting to technical progress for the sixth time Council directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations. Accordingly a final import decision should be taken for actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and tremolite and a revised and updated final decision should be taken in respect of crocidolite.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The chemical DNOC has been added to the interim PIC procedure, as a pesticide, for which the Commission has received information from the interim Secretariat in the form of a decision guidance document.

The Commission has received information from the interim secretariat in the form of a decision guidance document. The chemicals benomyl, carbofuran and thiram fall within the scope of Directive 91/414/EEC. By Commission Decision 2002/928/EC of 26 November 2002 concerning the non-inclusion of benomyl in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance, benomyl has been excluded from Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and authorisations for plant protection products containing it had to be withdrawn by 25 May 2003. Carbofuran is currently subject to an ongoing assessment within the framework of Directive 91/414/EEC. That Directive provides for a transitional period during which Member States are allowed to take national decisions on substances and products falling with its scope pending a Community decision. By Commission Directive 2003/81/EC of 5 September 2003 amending Directive 91/414/EEC to include molinate, thiram and ziram as active substances, thiram has been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and is authorised for use in plant protection products subject to certain conditions. Thiram has also been notified under Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market, which provides for a transitional period during which Member States may, pending a Community decision, take a decision on substances and products falling within its scope. Consequently, an interim import decision should be taken for dustable powder formulations containing a combination of benomyl, carbofuran and thiram at or above the specified concentrations.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up pursuant to Article 29 of Council Directive 67/548/EEC, as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/59/EC,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e231-11-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The final decision on the import of the chemicals actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite, crocidolite and tremolite, as set out in the import response form contained in Annex I, is adopted.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e236-11-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">The final decision on the import of the chemical DNOC, as set out in the import response form contained in Annex II, is adopted.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e241-11-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">The interim decision on the import of dustable powder pesticide formulations containing a combination of benomyl at or above 7 %, carbofuran at or above 10 % and thiram at or above 15 %, as set out in the import response form in Annex III, is also adopted.</p></section>
