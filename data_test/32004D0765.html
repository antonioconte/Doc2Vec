This type of measure is already in place for citrus fruit under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001, in particular because of the method for calculating the maximum residue levels which, for these products, takes into account that they are normally consumed peeled.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">However, such a measure applied unilaterally and indiscriminately by Germany in respect of all fruit and vegetables would be sure to hinder intra-Community trade to a disproportionate extent. It would oblige producers or operators in other Member States to provide specific labelling for fruit, vegetables and potatoes imported into Germany and to take measures to this effect right from the start of the production process, depending on the destination of the products.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The cases where non-harmonised national provisions governing the labelling and presentation of certain foodstuffs or foodstuffs in general may be acceptable are listed limitatively in Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC.
