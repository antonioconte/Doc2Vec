To achieve this, the Council conclusions also called for a high-level mechanism of governance following which a Joint Action and a Thematic Network were launched in the framework respectively of the Health Programme and the ICT Policy Support Programme of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (hereafter ‘the Joint Action’ and ‘the Thematic Network’). To ensure coordination, coherence and consistency of the work on eHealth at Union level and to avoid duplication of work, it is appropriate to ensure continuation of the work of the high level mechanism above mentioned within the framework of the eHealth Network, in so far as this work is compatible with the objectives assigned to the Network by Article 14(2) of Directive 2011/24/EU, and to link the Joint Action and the Thematic Network to the eHealth Network.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 16 of Directive 2011/24/EU,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e169-48-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><h4><b>Subject matter</b></h4><p class="normal">This Decision sets the necessary rules for the establishment, the management and the functioning of the Network of national responsible authorities on eHealth, as provided for by Article 14(1) of Directive 2011/24/EU.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e176-48-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><h4><b>Task</b></h4><p class="normal">1.
