The types of soil are described in the application for registration as deep, rich and well-drained. The semi-continental climate of the production area is marked by high temperatures in summer and sunny days alternating with cool nights in late autumn. However, such climate and soil conditions prevail in other regions where cabbages are grown and they are not, therefore, specific according to Article 2(2)(b). As regards the fermentation process, the specifications contain no elements which allow it to be described as ‘natural’ or to attribute it to the Alsace region alone. The specific quality or a particular characteristic of <span class="italic">choucroute</span> cannot, therefore, be based on such elements.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards the reputation of the name <span class="italic">Choucroute d’Alsace</span>, the elements of proof contained in the application for registration basically refer to <span class="italic">choucroute garnie (choucroute</span> cooked and served with meat).
