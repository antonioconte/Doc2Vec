Where it is necessary, for certain vitamins and minerals, to establish restrictions regarding the foods to which they can be added (e.g. the addition of iodine to salt), priority should be given to the purposes of restoring their content where this has been reduced during manufacturing, storage or handling procedures and of providing a similar nutritional value to foods for which those foods are intended as alternatives.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(16)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Vitamins and minerals added to foods should result in a minimum amount being present in the food.
