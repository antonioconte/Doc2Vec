The basic principle of this innovative technology is to decouple the combustion engine from the drivetrain and prevent deceleration caused by engine braking. The function should be automatically activated in the predominant driving mode, which is the mode automatically selected when the vehicle is switched on. Thus coasting can be used to increase the rolling distance of the vehicle in situations where no propulsion or a slow reduction of speed is needed. When ‘coasting’, the kinetic and potential energy of the vehicle is directly used to overcome driving resistance and, as consequence, to decrease fuel consumption. To obtain less deceleration the engine is decoupled from the drivetrain by opening a clutch. This is done automatically by the control unit of the automatic transmission. During these coasting phases the engine is running at idle speed (‘engine idle coasting’).</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission approved by way of Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1132 an application by Porsche AG concerning a coasting function intended for use in Porsche S-segment M1 vehicles (sport coupé) only.

To compare the vehicle fitted with engine idle coasting function with a baseline vehicle where the coasting function is not installed, not available in the predominant driving mode or disabled for testing purposes, both vehicles should be tested on the same modified NEDC test cycle. However, in view of the difficulties for the baseline vehicle to follow the speed-trace of the modified NEDC test cycle, the test of the baseline vehicle is performed on the standard NEDC under hot start conditions, while the modified conditions are taken into account by a conversion factor being applied for the calculation of the CO<span class="sub">2</span> savings. The determination of the conversion factor is vehicle-specific and related primarily to the powertrain hardware configuration. Based on previous studies, the conversion factor appears to lie within the range 0,96 to 0,99. The applicant has requested that the conversion factor should be set at the level of 0,98. The Commission finds however that the applicant has not provided sufficient evidence for justifying a conversion factor higher than 0,96. In view of this, it is considered appropriate to maintain the conversion factor at the lower end of the identified range, i.e. at the value of 0,960, in line with the conversion factor defined in Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1132.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">A key element in determining the CO<span class="sub">2</span> savings is the proportion of the distance travelled by the vehicle over which the coasting function will be activated, taking into account that the coasting function may be deactivated in other driving modes than the predominant driving mode. The applicant has proposed a usage factor of 0,7 which relates the observed distance covered under coasting conditions during real world driving tests to the coasting distance under modified NEDC conditions. However, that proposed usage factor resulted as a best case value without robust supporting analysis. Based on additional analysis and taking into account the analysis made for the purpose of Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/1132, it is appropriate to consider a more conservative usage factor equal to 0,62.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The case study conducted by BMW AG concerned two vehicles having the engine idle coasting technology active until 40km/h.

Nevertheless, the influence of the more extended coasting period upon the usage factor has not been analysed by the applicant.
