Consequently, according to the Court of Justice, it includes also measures of physical protection. The Court of Justice also stated in its Ruling 1/78 that provisions related to criminal prosecution and extradition relate to matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Member States.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">According to Article 18(4) of the CPPNM, when becoming party to the Convention the Community must communicate to the depositary a declaration indicating which articles of the CPPNM do not apply to it.
