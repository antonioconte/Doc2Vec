As regards objects intended for drinking, e.g. tea set cups, CEN concluded that no incidents with these toys nor with real drinking cups have been registered. On the basis of these investigations CEN decided that there were no grounds to extend the standardisation work to this particular type of toys.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">At the request of the Commission, the Member States experts on the safety of toys informed the Commission of incidents caused by similar toys.
