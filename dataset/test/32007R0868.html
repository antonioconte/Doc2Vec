In their objections, Germany and Italy stated that the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 had not been fulfilled and that in particular the link between the product and the geographical area was not demonstrated to the requisite legal standard and was thus insufficient to satisfy the definition of a geographical indication. In addition, Germany pointed out that certain elements contained in the product specification were likely to be in breach of Council Directive 2001/110/EC on honey of 20 December 2001, in particular the option of adding dried fruit to the honey, which according to Germany was not in compliance with the definition of ‘honey’ given in the Directive.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In a letter of 16 November 2005 the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement amongst themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Given that no agreement was reached between Spain, Germany and Italy within the designated time frame, the Commission must adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure outlined in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Following consultation between Spain, Germany and Italy, details have been added to the product specification of the designations in question.
