Accordingly, the scientific data and other information included in the seven studies may not be used for the benefit of a subsequent applicant for a period of 5 years from the date of authorisation, under the conditions laid down in Article 21(1) of that Regulation. For the two studies, which had been published prior to the submission of the application for authorisation of the health claim, it is considered that as the studies have been published and made available to the public domain, their protection is not justified in the light of the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 among which to protect the investment made by innovators in gathering the information and data supporting an application under that Regulation and accordingly it should not be granted.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The comments from the applicant received by the Commission, pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Decision.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Member States have been consulted,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e196-55-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The health claim set out in the Annex to this Decision shall be included in the Community list of permitted claims as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e201-55-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">The scientific data and other information included in the studies identified in the Annex to this Decision shall be restricted for use for the benefit of the applicant for a period of 5 years from the date of authorisation under the conditions laid down in Article 21(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e206-55-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Decision is addressed to Provexis Natural Products Ltd, Thames Court, 1 Victoria Street, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 1YB, United Kingdom.</p></section>
