That assumption shall be supported by detailed data explaining the assumed percentage of metal content, as well as the assumed percentage of metal reuse, recovery and recycling. This data should be valid in respect of at least 95 % of the end-of-life vehicles arising in the Member State in question.</p><p class="normal">3.
