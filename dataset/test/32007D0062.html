It should be noted that emissions of these F-Gases are estimated to double by 2010 in the absence of further regulation with increasing use of refrigeration and also as a result of the up-coming phase out of HCFCs from refrigeration under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(46)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Regulation (EC) 842/2006 is expected to result in significant F-gases emission reductions throughout the Community, principally in those Member States where appropriate measures for reducing F-gases emissions are not yet in place, mainly by measures aimed at improving the containment and recovery of F-gases used in certain applications. However, the Danish legislation had already introduced comparable provisions (containment policy based notably on compulsory training programmes, regular checks for leakages)more than 50 years ago, which was then applied to applications containing F-gases, and are therefore unlikely to result in further reductions that could significantly counter the expected growth in F-gases emissions in Denmark.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(47)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Considering the above, the Commission considers that the environmental justification given by Denmark, namely the reduction and prevention of fluorinated gases emissions, is valid.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e588-130-1">2.2.2.2.

Annex I of the Order contains specific derogations for a number of highly specific applications (e.g medical aerosols, laboratory equipment) and, for some more common applications, exemptions which are based on the quantity of fluorinated gases used in the respective systems, which results in exempting refrigeration units, heat pumps or air conditioning units with charges between 0,15 kg and 10 kg as well as refrigeration systems for recovering heat with a charge less or equal to 50 kg.
