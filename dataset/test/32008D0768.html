However, rather than providing for general exceptions and derogations for such enterprises, which might imply that they or their products are second-rate or sub-quality and which might result in a complex legal situation for the national market surveillance authorities to supervise, Community legislation should provide for the situation of such enterprises to be taken into account in setting the rules for the selection and implementation of the most appropriate conformity assessment procedures and concerning the obligations placed on conformity assessment bodies to operate in a proportionate manner in relation to the size of undertakings and to the small serial or non-serial nature of the production concerned. This Decision provides the legislator with the flexibility necessary to take account of such a situation, without creating unnecessary specific and inappropriate solutions for small and medium-sized enterprises, and without compromising the protection of public interests.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(51)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">This Decision establishes provisions for conformity assessment bodies to perform their functions, while taking into consideration the specific situation of small and medium-sized enterprises and respecting the degree of rigour and level of protection required for products to comply with the legislative instruments applicable to them.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(52)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Within one year of the publication of this Decision in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>, the Commission should present an in-depth analysis in the field of consumer safety markings, followed by legislative proposals if necessary,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e471-82-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><h4><b>General principles</b></h4><p class="normal">1.
