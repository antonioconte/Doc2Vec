Germany and the Netherlands indicated in their statements of objection that the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 had not been met. In particular, in Germany’s view, the link between the product and the region had not been shown. In the view of the Netherlands, the link between the geographical area (of production) in question and the name ‘Salame Cremona’ had not been shown sufficiently, on the one hand, and on the other hand, in the absence of any additional requirement, limiting the origin of the basic pork ingredients to the north and centre of Italy (or even to the geographical area identified in point 4.3) must be deemed simply a barrier to trade; finally, it is not established in point 4.5 how requiring that Salame Cremona be produced, packaged and sliced only in the area of production is helpful as regards controls and traceability, or in preserving the qualitative characteristics of the product.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">By letters dated 2 March 2006, the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Given that no agreement was reached between Italy, Germany and the Netherlands within the designated time frame, the Commission must adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure outlined in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Following consultation between Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, details have been added to the product specification of the designation in question. In response to the comment from Germany and the Netherlands that the link between the product and the region had not been shown, it has been clearly stated that the link is based on reputation. In response to the second comment from the Netherlands, the restriction regarding the regions from which the basic ingredient may come has been dropped and more details have been included as to specific conditions for the breeding and feeding of the pigs, and the influence of these factors on the characteristics of the final product. Finally, the Italian authorities have argued that it is necessary for control reasons that the product be sliced and packaged in the area. The Italian authorities have also argued that, were the product to be transported in temperature-controlled conditions and sliced ‘at a remove in terms of time and space’, the organoleptic characteristics of the sausage would be affected. The Dutch authorities have said that they accept these explanations on condition that they be included in the application, which they now have been.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the Commission's opinion, the amended version of the product specification is fully in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In light of the above, the designation should be entered into the ‘Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e152-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The designation contained in Annex I to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e157-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">A summary of the main points of the specification is given in Annex II to this Regulation.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e162-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
