The Commission has, however, accepted this exception as the testing and analysis of waste is necessary to ascertain the characteristics of some wastes, including whether it is hazardous or non-hazardous. Thus the correct waste reference can only be assigned after the testing and the waste treated appropriately. The exemption does not extend to any treatment of the waste that will be regulated under a separate waste authorisation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission is of the opinion that with regard to the notified exemptions the provision of the limits for the content of hazardous substances in the waste and emission limit values would be disproportionate.
