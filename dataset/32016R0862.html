The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: ‘Consumption of high-fibre sourdough rye bread contributes to a reduction of glycaemic response accompanied with a decreased insulin response after a meal’.

Authorisation may be legitimately withheld if health claims do not comply with other general and specific requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, even in the case of a favourable scientific assessment by the Authority. The Authority noted in its scientific opinion that, when comparable amounts of available carbohydrates from different carbohydrate-containing foods are tested, almost any carbohydrate-containing food would induce a reduction of post-prandial blood glucose responses compared with the blood glucose responses elicited by the consumption of glucose. In addition, it noted that foods containing low amounts of carbohydrates or no available carbohydrates would also induce lower post-prandial blood glucose responses when compared with glucose.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 defines ‘claim’ as any message or representation which states, suggests or implies that a food has particular characteristics. A claim on high-fibre sourdough rye bread and post-prandial glycaemic responses would suggest that high-fibre sourdough rye bread has particular characteristics in relation to the reduction of post-prandial glycaemic responses when compared with glucose, while in fact almost all foods have that effect. Point (a) of the second paragraph of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that the use of health claims shall not be misleading.
