The Commission identified certain relevant information as missing in the original application and requested the Applicant to complete it. The Applicant provided the information on 30 January 2014.

The alternator has an efficiency of at least 77 per cent as determined in accordance with the VDA approach described in point 5.1.2 in Annex I to the Technical Guidelines. That approach makes reference to the testing methodology specified in the International standard ISO 8854:2012. The Applicant's alternator has an increased efficiency compared to the baseline alternator by reducing the following three losses: rectification losses by optimising the rectification by the use of a ‘MOSFET module’, i.e. by a use of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor; stator iron losses by the use of thin laminated core made by magnetic steel, and stator copper losses by the use of a ‘segment conductor’, which has higher space factor and shorter coil end. This technology is therefore different from the Valeo Efficient Generation Alternator approved as an eco-innovation by Commission Implementing Decision 2013/341/EU.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission finds that the information provided in the application demonstrates that the conditions and criteria referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and in Articles 2 and 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 have been met.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Applicant has demonstrated that a high efficiency alternator of the kind described in this application did not exceed 3 % of the new passenger cars registered in the reference year 2009.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to determine the CO<span class="sub">2</span> savings that the innovative technology will deliver when fitted to a vehicle, it is necessary to define the baseline vehicle against which the efficiency of the vehicle equipped with the innovative technology should be compared as provided for in Articles 5 and 8 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011. The Commission finds that it is appropriate to consider an alternator with 67 % efficiency as an appropriate baseline technology in the case the innovative technology is fitted on a new vehicle type. Where the DENSO efficient alternator is fitted to an existing vehicle type, the baseline technology should be the alternator of the most recent version of that type placed on the market.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Applicant has provided a methodology for testing the CO<span class="sub">2</span> reductions which includes formulae that are consistent with the formulae described in the Technical Guidelines for the simplified approach with regard to efficient alternators.
