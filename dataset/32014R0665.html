It ensures the preservation of higher altitude pastures that are not suited for all-year grazing and of traditional man-made landscapes in mountain areas. Transhumance also has direct environmental benefits, for example reducing the risk of erosion and avalanches. In order to encourage the continued practice of transhumance, it should therefore also be allowed to apply the term ‘mountain product’ to products made from transhumant animals which spend at least a quarter of their lifetime on pastures in mountain areas.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to ensure that feedstuffs for farm animals come essentially from mountain areas, it should be clarified that, in principle, at least half of their annual animal diet, expressed as a percentage of dry matter, should consist of feedstuffs coming from mountain areas.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As available feedstuffs for ruminants in mountain areas represent more than half of their annual diet, this percentage should be higher in their case.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Because of natural constraints and the fact that feedstuffs produced in mountain areas are primarily for ruminants, only a small proportion of feedstuffs for pigs is currently sourced in mountain areas.
