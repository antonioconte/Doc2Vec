They also claim that in no case a variety obtained from an interspecies cross could be considered as belonging to the species <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span>. According to the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and FEDERDOC, in any country of the European Union, the examination of the genome makes it possible to determine whether a variety belongs to the species <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span> or a cross with another species of the genus <span class="italic">Vitis</span>.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Italian Ministry of Agriculture additionally claims that the reference to human factors is insufficient, as is the causal link between natural and human factors, and information on the quality and characteristics of the product attributable to the geographical environment.

Firstly, there is no harmonised classification of a vine variety belonging to <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span> at EU level. In addition, there is no reference list or scientific document available from any official competent body, such as the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), which currently would allow to undisputedly categorize <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span> species or a cross between the <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span> species and other species of the genus <span class="italic">Vitis</span>, or to distinguish between them. Against this background, the issue of scientific definition should primarily be addressed in the preliminary national assessment conducted by the Member States in accordance with Article 96 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Denmark relies on the German classification where all five wine grape varieties in question are classified as belonging to <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span>. Secondly, pursuant to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 regarding the Scrutiny of an objection, the Commission shall take any decision to reject or register the designation of origin on the basis of the evidence available to it. In the case at hand the objectors did not provide any solid scientific evidence or data proving that the product is not obtained from vine varieties belonging to <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span>. Lastly, the Commission notes that several other Member States use the wine grape varieties in question in the production of their wines with Protected Designation of Origin.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">For the above reasons, it is not possible to conclude that the product referred to by the name ‘Dons’ is obtained from vine varieties not belonging to <span class="italic">Vitis vinifera</span>.

It is, therefore, to conclude that the necessary elements of the link have been included in line with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 607/2009. As for the human factors, the acidity profile of the product is deemed attributable to the selection of relatively hardy varieties in line with Article 93(1)(a)(i) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(13)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards the allegations that it is superfluous to state the requirements which are prescribed by the Regulation, since parts of the requirements go beyond the Union law, their inclusion seems appropriate for the reasons of clarity and correct understanding of the requirements by potentially eligible producers.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above and in accordance with Article 99 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, the Commission considers that the application meets the conditions laid down in that Regulation and that the name ‘Dons’ should be protected and entered in the register referred to in Article 104 of that Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(15)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e303-37-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The name ‘Dons’ (PDO) is hereby protected.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e312-37-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
