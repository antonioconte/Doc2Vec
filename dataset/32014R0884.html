A full harmonisation of the controls on the import of food of non-animal origin is not possible because it is impossible to perform all required physical controls on aflatoxins at the designated point of entry. The control on the presence of aflatoxins in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 401/2006 is time consuming and requires an unloading of the consignment. Furthermore, many commodities covered by this Regulation are transported in vacuum packing and destruction of the vacuum packing through the sampling might result in quality loss in case the consignment needs to be transported over a long distance after the physical control. However in order to reduce administrative burden, it is appropriate to harmonise as much as possible the administrative documents related to the controls on feed and food of non-animal origin. Therefore, while the conditions for import for the feed and food covered by this Regulation are not identical for the feed and food covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009, it is appropriate to use the same Common Entry Document (CED) in view of administrative simplification for the feed and food business operators. However, it is necessary for the application of that CED for this Regulation, to provide additional explanatory notes in the notes for guidance to address the differences in the control systems.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e212-4-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><h4><b>Scope</b></h4><p class="normal">1.
