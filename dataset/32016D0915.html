The 35th Session of the ICAO Assembly (2004) endorsed the further development of an open emissions trading system and the possibility for ICAO Contracting States to incorporate emissions from international aviation into their emissions trading schemes, but the 36th Session of the ICAO Assembly (2007) called for aircraft operators based in other ICAO Contracting States to be exempt unless it were mutually agreed between those States to implement an emissions trading system on other ICAO Contracting State's aircraft operators. The Union, its Member States and other European States have consistently reserved the right to apply market-based measures (MBMs) on a non-discriminatory basis to all aircraft operators providing services to, from or within their territory, recalling that the Chicago Convention recognises its Parties' rights to apply, on a non-discriminatory basis, their own aviation laws and regulations to the aircrafts of all States providing services to, from or within their territory.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Considering that the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation is an essential contribution in line with overall emission-reduction commitments, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2008/101/EC which amended Directive 2003/87/EC.

International aviation emissions are projected to be around 70 % higher in 2020 than in 2005 and the Union and its Member States have consistently advocated that the global reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation should be a 10 % reduction by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. However, it appears expedient for the Union to seize the opportunity to promote the development, within a rather short time frame, of a global MBM to limit greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation no higher than their 2020 levels, bearing in mind the review of the objective over time, as appropriate.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to facilitate progress at the 2016 ICAO Assembly towards an appropriate international instrument, the European Parliament and the Council decided, by virtue of Regulation (EU) No 421/2014, to consider on a temporary basis the requirements of Directive 2003/87/EC to be satisfied in respect of flights to and from aerodromes located in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
