That Decision required that prior to placing on the market, operators should submit an analytical report to the relevant Member State competent authorities demonstrating that the consignment of rice products was not contaminated with genetically modified rice Bt 63.

The obligation to provide an analytical report on sampling and analysis demonstrating the absence of genetically modified rice events, established by Decision 2008/289/EC, should be maintained. However, it is appropriate to reinforce Member State controls through enhanced frequency of sampling and analysis which should be set at 100 % of all consignments of rice products originating from China, and to introduce the obligation for food and feed operators to give prior notification of the estimated date, time and place of the physical arrival of the consignment.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Sampling methodologies play a crucial role in obtaining representative and comparable results; it is therefore appropriate to define a common protocol for sampling and analysis for the control of the absence of genetically modified rice in imports originating from China.
