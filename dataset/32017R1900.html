Then, in 1989, it was registered in that same List as ‘Varaždinski kupus’/‘Varaždinsko zelje’. At present, this variety is listed in the Lists of all the states which have emerged after the dissolution of the SFRY. The Republic of Slovenia registered the variety ‘Varaždinski’/‘Varaždinsko’ after the independence. The Croatian variety ‘Varaždinski kupus’ and the Slovenian varieties ‘Varaždinsko 2’ and ‘Varaždinsko 3’ are all listed in the Common catalogue of varieties and vegetable species of the European Union.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">According to the opponent, the produce from these varieties is known as ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro.

The product has characteristics, in particular high total phenol and flavonoid content, high dry matter content and exceptionally high sugar content, which are essentially due to the natural and human factors of its particular geographical environment. The high dry matter content and exceptionally high sugar content of ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ are due to the production method, i.e. the fact that the product, which can tolerate low temperatures, is left in the field until late autumn. The high total phenol and flavonoid content in ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ is due to the product's genetic properties, as well as environmental and growing conditions. ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ is produced only from the seed of the conservation variety ‘Varaždinski kupus’ entered in the EU variety register. The term ‘conservation variety’ indicates that the seed is produced only in the defined geographical area and nowhere else.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards the claim concerning the misleading nature of the name, the Commission considers that the name refers to the area where the product is produced.

The name ‘Varaždinsko zelje’, as used in Slovenia, indicates that the product consists of a cabbage of the Varaždinsko variety. No evidence of the use of the name irrespectively of the cabbage variety was found. In the light of the above, the function of variety indicator of the term ‘Varaždinsko’ being predominant, the Commission considers not appropriate to grant a transitional period for the use of the Slovenian name ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ as such.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(16)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">However, the use on labelling of the names of the varieties Varaždinsko 2 and Varaždinsko 3, registered in the common Catalogue of Varieties of Vegetable Species of the European Union, is still allowed for seeds and cabbage products produced outside the geographical area without limitation of time. In accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, notwithstanding the registration of the name ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ as PDO, the names Varaždinsko 2 and Varaždinsko 3 may be used on the labelling provided that the conditions listed thereto are met. In particular, for the cabbage product, the label should clearly show the indication of the country of origin and not include any allusion to Croatia. This will, in addition, guarantee the correct information of consumers in comparison with the product marketed under the registered PDO.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(17)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ should be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(18)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Agricultural Product Quality Policy Committee,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e342-7-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The name ‘Varaždinsko zelje’ (PDO) is registered.</p><p class="normal">The name in the first paragraph identifies a product from class 1.6.
