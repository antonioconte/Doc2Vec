In that review, substances found to pose a significant risk should be considered for inclusion in the priority substances list.

To ensure that the monitoring data gathered for that substance fully reflect the risk that it poses, the Commission will further investigate whether Member States could monitor it in sediment in a reliable and comparable manner.

Therefore those substances should be retained in the watch list. Macrolide antibiotics and neonicotinoids were included as groups in the first watch list to account for the fact that substances with the same mode of action could have additive effects. This argument also justifies keeping the two groups in the watch list, despite the fact that sufficient high-quality monitoring data are available for some of the individual substances in those groups (the macrolide antibiotics clarithromycin and erythromycin, and the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin and thiacloprid).</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">During 2017, the Commission also gathered data on a range of other substances that could be included in the watch list.

Substances for which doubt exists about their toxicity, or for which the sensitivity, reliability or comparability of the available monitoring methods are not adequate, should not be included in the watch list. The insecticide metaflumizone, and the antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin, were identified as suitable candidates. The inclusion of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin is consistent with the European One Health Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) , which supports the use of the watch list to ‘improve knowledge of the occurrence and spread of antimicrobials in the environment’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In accordance with Article 8b(1) of Directive 2008/105/EC, the Commission identified possible methods of analysis for the proposed substances.
