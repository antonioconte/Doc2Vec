Since such MRL was set to accommodate an import tolerance request based on authorised uses in Brazil, the applicant has been contacted in order to avoid trade barriers. The applicant proposed a fall-back MRL of 0,5 mg/kg, which is sufficient to accommodate the uses authorised in Brazil. As a high level of consumer protection is maintained, it is appropriate to set that MRL to 0,5 mg/kg.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards all other applications, the Authority concluded that all requirements with respect to data were met and that the modifications to the MRLs requested by the applicants were acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups.
