In that Roadmap, the Commission laid out a cost-effective way of achieving the necessary overall emission reductions in the Union by 2050. That roadmap establishes the sectoral contributions needed in six areas. Non-CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions from agriculture, should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. If based on the reference year 2005, a reduction in non-CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, except those from agriculture, of 60 % to 61 % by 2030 is required. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 90 million tonnes (Mt) of CO<span class="sub">2</span> equivalent in 2005.
