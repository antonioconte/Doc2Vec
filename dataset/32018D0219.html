Linking cap and trade systems is expected to result in broader carbon pricing, increasing the availability of reduction opportunities and enhancing the cost-efficiency of emissions trading. The development of a well-functioning international carbon market through bottom-up linking of emissions trading systems (‘ETS’) is a long term policy goal of the Union and the international community, notably as a means to achieve the climate objectives, including under the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Agreement should be approved.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">It is essential that aviation be covered by the Swiss ETS in order to link the Swiss ETS with the Union's ETS.
