Community legislation has established appropriate standards for ambient air quality for the protection of human health and sensitive individuals in particular, as well as for national emission ceilings. Following its communication of 4 May 2001, which established the ‘Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) programme’, the Commission adopted another communication on 21 September 2005 entitled ‘Thematic strategy for air pollution’. One of the conclusions of that thematic strategy is that further reductions in emissions from the transport sector (air, maritime and land transport), from households and from the energy, agricultural and industrial sectors are needed to achieve EU air quality objectives. In this context, the task of reducing vehicle emissions should be approached as part of an overall strategy. The Euro VI standards are one of the measures designed to reduce the actual in-use emissions of air pollutants such as particulate pollutants (PM) as well as ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NO<span class="sub">x</span>) and hydrocarbons.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Achieving EU air quality objectives requires a continuous effort to reduce vehicle emissions.
