One of the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 is that the intake of the substance should greatly exceed normal intake of a balanced and varied diet and it should present a potential risk to consumers as demonstrated by relevant scientific data. Further, Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 provides that the procedure should also be applied where the substance presents a potential risk to health for reasons other than a great excess of its normal intake.
