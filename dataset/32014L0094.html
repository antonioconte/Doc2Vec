The quality of natural gas used in the Union depends on its origin, on its constituents, for example biomethane blended into natural gas, and on the way in which natural gas is handled through the distribution chain. Therefore, a spread of technical characteristics could prevent the optimal use of engines and reduce their energy efficiency. In this respect, the Technical Committee CEN/TC 408 — Project Committee is developing a set of quality specifications for natural gas used in transport and for the injection of biomethane into the natural gas grid.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(41)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Member States should ensure, by means of their national policy frameworks, that an appropriate number of refuelling points accessible to the public for the supply of CNG or compressed biomethane to motor vehicles is built up, in order to ensure that CNG motor vehicles can circulate in urban/suburban agglomerations and other densely populated areas as well as throughout the Union, at least along the existing TEN-T Core Network.
