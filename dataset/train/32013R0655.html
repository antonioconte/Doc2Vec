A common approach at Union level should also ensure better convergence of actions taken by the Member States’ competent authorities, and prevent distortions in the internal market. Such an approach should also enhance cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation).</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 applies to products that fall under the definition of a cosmetic product in Article 2 of this Regulation.
