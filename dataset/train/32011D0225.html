Germany reported that one case of child injury is attributed to the use of POR-ÇÖZ in Germany. Furthermore, between 1999 and 2010, German poison centres registered 134 cases of severe injuries to health related to the use in households of lime and rust removers containing nitric acid. In Belgium (the only other Member State where a Turkish-labelled version of POR-ÇÖZ had been found on the market) anti-poison centres have recorded three cases of severe respiratory problems resulting from the professional use of limescale removers containing 30 % nitric acid. Based on an assessment of the risks to health from the use of cleaning products with a nitric acid content of 20-30 %, on 28 September 2010, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment recommended that cleaning products containing more than 20 % nitric acid should not be placed on the market for supply to the general public.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission has consulted the Member States both via questionnaires sent out on 15 November 2010 and in a meeting of the Detergents Working Group Meeting on 14 December 2010.
