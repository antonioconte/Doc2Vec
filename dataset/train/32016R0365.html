The opposition claims that the registration of the name ‘Telemea de Ibănești’ would jeopardise the existence of the partly identical name ‘Τελεμές’ (Telemés) and the existence of products which have been legally on the Greek market for at least five years preceding the date of publication of the application for registration of the name ‘Telemea de Ibănești’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">By letter of 22 June 2015 the Commission invited the interested parties to engage in appropriate consultations to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Romania and Greece reached an agreement, which was notified to the Commission on 21 September 2015, within the prescribed deadline.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As it results from the information exchanged with Greece in the context of the opposition procedure, Romania produces at national level a cheese named ‘Telemea’.
