It is also required because of the need to guarantee that the cheese is packaged quickly after portioning using appropriate methods to prevent the cheese being dehydrated, oxidised or losing its original “Parmigiano Reggiano” organoleptic characteristics.

Having regard in particular to ongoing contractual obligations and the need to adapt the market progressively following the amendments to the specification for the name ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’, operators not established in the geographical area defined in the specification should be allowed a transitional period of 1 year in so far as they were legally engaged in portioning and packaging ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’ outside the defined geographical area for at least 5 years prior to 16 April 2009.
