The impact assessment and a study commissioned by the Commission examined several options for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance with respect to the most relevant stages of the life of the animals. The results show that consumers require foremost the information on the place where the animal was reared. At the same time, providing mandatory information on the place of birth of the animal would require the establishment of new traceability systems at farm level with the respective costs stemming therefrom, while labelling the place of slaughter can be done at an affordable cost and gives valuable information to the consumer. As regards the geographical level there is evidence that indication of the Member State or third country would be the most relevant information for consumers.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Within Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 the concept of ‘country of origin’ of a food is determined in accordance with Articles 23 to 26 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92. For animal products that concept refers to the country in which the product is wholly obtained which applied to meat means the country in which the animal was born, reared and slaughtered. When several countries have been involved in the production of a food, that concept refers to the country where the products have undergone their last substantial and economically justified processing or working. However, applying it to situations in which the meat comes from animals which were born, reared and slaughtered in different countries would not sufficiently inform the consumers about the origin of that meat. Therefore, in all those situations it is necessary to provide for an indication, on the label, of the Member State or third country where the animal has been reared for a period representing a substantial part of the normal cycle of rearing for each species, as well as of the Member State or third country where it has been slaughtered. The term ‘origin’ should be reserved for meat obtained from animals born, reared and slaughtered, and therefore wholly obtained, in one single Member State or third country.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">For the cases in which the animal has been reared in several Member States or third countries and the rearing period cannot be met, an appropriate indication of the place of rearing should be provided for so that the consumer needs are better met and unnecessary complexity of the label is avoided.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In addition, rules should be laid down for packages containing pieces of meat of the same or different species obtained from animals reared and slaughtered in different Member States or third countries.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">This labelling system requires traceability rules at all stages of production and distribution of the meat, from slaugthering until packaging to ensure the link between the labelled meat and the animal or group of animals from which that meat has been obtained.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Specific rules should be provided for meat imported from third countries where the information required for labelling is not available.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards minced meat and trimmings, given the characteristics of their production processes, operators should be allowed to make use of a simplified system of indications.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In view of the commercial interest of the information to be provided under this Regulation, food business operators should be given the possibility to add to the mandatory indications on the label other elements referring to the provenance of the meat.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 are applicable from 13 December 2014, and Article 47 thereof provides for application of the implementing rules under that Regulation as from 1 April in each calendar year, this Regulation should start to apply on 1 April 2015.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e165-19-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><h4><b>Subject matter and scope</b></h4><p class="normal">This Regulation lays down rules on the indication of the country of origin or place of provenance on the label of fresh, chilled and frozen meat of swine, meat of sheep or goats and meat of poultry, falling within the respective Combined Nomenclature codes listed in Annex XI to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e172-19-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><h4><b>Definitions</b></h4><p class="normal">1.
