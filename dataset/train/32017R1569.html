The manufacturing of investigational medicinal products presents additional challenges comparing to the manufacturing of authorised medicinal products because there are no fixed routines, there is a variety of clinical trial designs and consequently packaging designs. Those challenges are due to the need, often, of randomisation and to disguise the identity of the investigational medicinal products for the purpose of clinical trial (blinding). The toxicity, potency and sensitising potential of investigational medicinal products for human use may not be fully understood at the time of the trial, and the need to minimise all risks of cross-contamination is therefore of even greater importance than for authorised medicinal products. Because of this complexity, the manufacturing operations should be subject to a highly effective pharmaceutical quality system.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(2)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Good manufacturing practice as regards both medicinal products authorised to be placed on the market and investigational medicinal products are based on the same principles.
