It has similar effects to those of THC, which is responsible for the major psychoactive effects of cannabis, but ADB-CHMINACA has additional life-threatening toxicity. The high potency of ADB-CHMINACA on the one hand, and the fact that it can account for a large or unknown variable proportion of smoking mixtures on the other, means that it constitutes a significant poisoning risk.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">ADB-CHMINACA has been available in the Union since at least August 2014 and has been detected in 17 Member States. Due to the nature of ADB-CHMINACA, cases of detection are likely to be underreported since ADB-CHMINACA is not routinely screened for. In most cases, ADB-CHMINACA was seized as herbal or plant material and in powder form, but it has also been seized, though to a lesser extent, in other physical forms, for example in blotter form.
