Many of these pouches are made of a transparent plastic cover with a paper insert on which the health warnings can be printed. In some cases, pouches with a wraparound flap are made of polyethylene, polypropylene or laminate material which, according to the industry, would need to be redesigned in order to allow printing on both sides of the flap, in particular if the pouch is not multilayer.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to ensure that health warnings are positioned in the same place on all rectangular pouches and that the general warning and information message are easily visible, they should be printed on the surfaces that become visible when the unit packet is fully opened.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">For packets made of polyethylene, polypropylene or laminate material where there is a risk of ink migration if the inside of the wraparound flap is printed, it should be allowed for a transitional period to reposition the general warning and information message, in order to avoid printing on surfaces that come into direct contact with tobacco.
