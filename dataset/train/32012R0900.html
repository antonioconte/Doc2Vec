The term ‘Agneau de lait des Pyrénées’ used in translation, and in particular in Spanish language, could lead to confusion of consumers with respect to the true origin of the product. While there is no reason not to register the term ‘Agneau de lait des Pyrénées’, it is necessary to avoid such confusion and ensure fair usage. Therefore, the geographical component of the designation ‘Agneau de lait des Pyrénées’ should not be translated into other languages when marketing the product corresponding to the specification for ‘Agneau de lait des Pyrénées’. This would thus apply both for use of such translation on the label as well as in presentations or advertising of the product. Furthermore, with respect to labels, the country of origin should be indicated in the same field of vision as the term ‘Agneau de lait des Pyrénées’, in letters of the same size as those used for that term.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Agneau de lait des Pyrénées’ should be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e179-1-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e184-1-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">References to the term ‘Pyrénées’ shall not be translated when marketing products conforming to the specification of the designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation.</p><p class="normal">Labels containing the designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation shall indicate the country of origin in the same field of vision, in letters of the same size as those of the designation.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e195-1-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
