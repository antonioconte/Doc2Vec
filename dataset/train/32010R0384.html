The Authority concluded that for a daily intake of 1,5-2,4 g plant sterols/stanols added to foods such as yellow fat spreads, dairy products, mayonnaise and salad dressings an average reduction of between 7 and 10,5 % can be expected and that such reduction is of biological significance. In addition, the Authority indicated that the blood LDL cholesterol lowering effect is usually established within the 2-3 weeks and can be sustained by a continued consumption of plant sterols/stanols.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Accordingly, taking into account the scientific opinion from the Authority and in order to ensure that such health claims referring to the magnitude of the claimed effect are authorised in a way that would not mislead the consumer, and that their conditions of use are set in a coherent way, it is necessary to set different conditions of use than those proposed by the applicant.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Article 16(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that an opinion in favour of authorising a health claim should include certain particulars.
