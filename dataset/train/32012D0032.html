During use of a brush cutter fitted with such a cutting attachment, a link of the chain had been ejected and had fatally injured a bystander. The United Kingdom had taken measures to ensure the withdrawal from the market and from service of the cutting attachments concerned. At the meeting of the Machinery Committee held on 2 June 2010, the United Kingdom requested the Commission to examine the need for the adoption of a measure requiring Member States to prohibit the placing on the market of cutting attachments having similar technical characteristics.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Flail-type cutting attachments for brush cutters placed on the market separately in order to be assembled with a brush cutter by the operator, not covered by the risk assessment, the EC declaration of conformity and the instructions of a brush cutter manufacturer, are interchangeable equipment according to the definition set out in point (b) of Article 2 of Directive 2006/42/EC.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Section 1.3.2 of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC on the risk of break-up during operation requires the various parts of machinery and their linkages to be able to withstand the stresses to which they are subject when used.

The standard does not foresee cutting attachments consisting of more than one metal part. While application of the harmonised standard is voluntary, the standard indicates the state of the art to be taken into account when applying the essential health and safety requirements of Directive 2006/42/EC, according to the general principles set out in the introduction to Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The use of flail-type cutting attachments with linked metal parts gives rise to significantly higher residual risks of break-up during operation and of ejection of objects than single part metal blades. The metal parts of flail-type cutting attachments and their linkages are subject to repeated high mechanical stresses when they come into contact with stones, rocks and other obstacles and are liable to break-up and be ejected at high speed. They are also liable to eject stones with higher energy than single part metal blades. The guards fitted to portable hand-held brush cutters cannot provide adequate protection against the higher risks created by flail-type cutting attachments with linked metal parts. Consequently, taking account of the state of the art, flail-type cutting attachments for portable hand-held brush cutters cannot be considered to comply with the requirements set out in sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC. That non-conformity gives rise to a significant risk of serious or fatal injury to users and other exposed persons.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On 22 October 2010, the Commission consulted the European Garden Machinery Federation on a draft measure to deal with dangerous cutting attachments for brush cutters.
