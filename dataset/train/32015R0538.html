A mathematical predictive method has been developed at the Technological University of Denmark, to determine which level of benzoic acid benzoate (E 210-213) is needed. According to that model the level of 1 000 mg/kg of E 210-213 is not sufficient to prevent growth of <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> in shrimps in brine at pH 5,8. In order to prevent growth of <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> in these shrimps, both the model and tests show that the optimal combination of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) and sorbic acid — sorbates (E 200-203) is 1 500 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg respectively.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In its report trends and sources of zoonoses, zoonotic agents and food-borne outbreaks in 2012, the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded that the number of listeriosis cases in humans increased slightly compared with 2011, and 1 642 confirmed human cases were reported in 2012. A statistically significant increasing trend in the Union was observed over the period 2008-2012, though only slowly increasing, along with a seasonal pattern. As in previous years, a high fatality rate (17,8 %) was reported among the cases. A total of 198 deaths due to listeriosis were reported by 18 Member States in 2012, which was the highest number of fatal cases reported since 2006. <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> was seldomly detected above the legal safety limit for ready-to-eat foods at point of retail.

At that time a maximum level in cooked shrimps of 2 000 mg/kg was set for sorbic acid — sorbates in combination with benzoic acid — benzoates. This level was revised by Directive 2006/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council when this authorisation was extended to all cooked crustaceans and molluscs, however with a maximum of 1 000 mg/kg for benzoic acid — benzoates. It is therefore expected that the increase of this level to 1 500 mg/kg, only for cooked shrimps in brine, will not lead to additional exposure that would be of safety concern.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health.
