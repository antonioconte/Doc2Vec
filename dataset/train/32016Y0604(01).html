These rates will produce a benchmark rate which is representative of the local mortgage market; and complete historical data on those rates are available for all Member States. However, since historical data on the ECB’s main refinancing rate are only available from 1 January 1999, the earliest start date of the historical period should be set on 1 January 1999. This earliest start date should apply to ESISs provided in all Member States in order to ensure that the same historical time period will be used across the European Union.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The formula should acknowledge that the borrowing rate will in part reflect funding costs, which the refinancing rate information is a proxy for, by also taking into account the lowest underlying rate in the preceding 20 years.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As the formula forms part of an illustrative example, it is sufficient that creditors update the underlying rate on an annual basis.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to ensure that, within each Member State, creditors use the same difference between the highest and the lowest values of the underlying rate, the calculation of the EBA benchmark rate should be done using the same reference date which should be the first working day of each year.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to ensure that the illustrative examples reflect local circumstances, the EBA benchmark rate should not be used, where a competent authority has specified a benchmark rate, the benchmark rate specified in this decision should not apply.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">EBA has conducted open public consultation on the draft decision on an EBA benchmark rate, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e160-8-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The benchmark rate referred to in Part B, Section 4, paragraph (2) and Section 6, paragraph (4) of Annex II to Directive 2014/17/EU (EBA benchmark rate) specified by the EBA is set out in the Annex.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e165-8-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
