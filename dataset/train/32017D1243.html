Those amendments should be treated as minor corrections. Launching appliances and winches are listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/306, which refers to the LSA Code and to Resolution MSC.81(70) in relation to items MED/1.21, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 as regards launching appliances, and in relation to items MED/1.41a, 1.41b, 1.41c, 1.41d, 1.41e as regards winches.

In view of the increasing number of ships equipped with EGCS, the amendments to Appendix V to MARPOL Annex VI are necessary in order to align the standard text of the BDN with the fact that ships may continue to use fuels with a higher sulphur content even after the entry into force of the 0,10 % sulphur content requirements in (S)ECAs as of 1 January 2015. The MARPOL Annex VI requirements as regards the limitation of SO<span class="sub">x</span> emissions are implemented in Union law by means of Directive (EU) 2016/802 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Article 6(9)(b) and (c) and Article 13(2)(a) of that Directive refer to the BDN as the principal mechanism for ensuring compliance with that Directive. Equivalent means of compliance are regarded as alternative emission abatement methods, as defined in Article 2(o) of that Directive, and may be used provided that the ships using the emission abatement method continuously achieve reductions of sulphur dioxide emissions that are at least equivalent to the reductions that would be achieved by using marine fuels that meet the requirements of that Directive.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Union is not a member of the IMO, nor is it a contracting party to the relevant conventions and codes.
