Thus, the Authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship had been established between the consumption of L-tyrosine in a protein adequate diet and contribution to normal synthesis of dopamine and proposed as appropriate conditions of use that ‘a food should be at least a source of protein <span class="italic">as per</span> Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission and the Member States have considered whether the health claim reflecting those conclusions should be authorised under the proposed conditions of use, since authorisation may also legitimately be withheld if health claims do not comply with other general and specific requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, even in the case of a favourable scientific assessment by the Authority. In the Authority’s response of 9 November 2012 to the request of the Commission, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, for clarification in relation to the evidence submitted for the health claim on L-tyrosine and the proposed conditions of use, the Authority noted that its conclusions for this claim were based on the well established biochemical role of L-tyrosine, as contained in protein. It added that, on the basis of the evidence submitted, it could not provide a quantitative indication of the necessary daily intake of L-tyrosine per se to produce the beneficial physiological effect. Therefore, it is not possible to establish specific conditions for the use of this claim to ensure that L-tyrosine is contained in the final product in a quantity that will produce the beneficial physiological effect in accordance with point (i) of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. In the absence of such specific conditions of use, the beneficial effect of the substance to which the claim relates cannot be assured and thus this claim could be misleading to the consumer.
