The management measures shall consist of lethal or non-lethal physical, chemical or biological actions aimed at the eradication, population control or containment of a population of an invasive alien species.

When applying management measures and selecting methods to be used, Member States shall have due regard to human health and the environment, especially non-targeted species and their habitats, and shall ensure that, when animals are targeted, they are spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering, without compromising the effectiveness of the management measures.</p><p class="normal">4. The surveillance system provided for in Article 14 shall be designed and used to monitor the effectiveness of eradication, population control or containment measures in minimising the impact on biodiversity, the related ecosystems services and, where applicable, on human health or the economy.

Where there is a significant risk that an invasive alien species of Union concern will spread to another Member State, the Member States in which that species is present shall immediately notify the other Member States and the Commission.
