However, experience shows that a harmonised approach to the regulation of clinical trials has only been partly achieved. This makes it in particular difficult to perform a given clinical trial in several Member States. Scientific development, however, suggests that future clinical trials will target more specific patient populations, such as subgroups identified through genomic information. In order to include a sufficient number of patients for such clinical trials it may be necessary to involve many, or all, Member States. The new procedures for the authorisation of clinical trials should stimulate the inclusion of as many Member States as possible. Therefore, in order to simplify the procedures for the submission of an application dossier for the authorisation of a clinical trial, the multiple submission of largely identical information should be avoided and replaced by the submission of one application dossier to all the Member States concerned through a single submission portal. Given that clinical trials carried out in a single Member State are equally important to European clinical research, the application dossier for such clinical trials should also be submitted through that single portal.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards Directive 2001/20/EC, experience also indicates that the legal form of a Regulation would present advantages for sponsors and investigators, for example in the context of clinical trials taking place in more than one Member State, since they will be able to rely on its provisions directly, but also in the context of safety reporting and labelling of investigational medicinal products.
