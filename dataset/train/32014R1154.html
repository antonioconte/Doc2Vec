During the evaluation of the claim, the applicant was requested to clarify how the proposed claim is linked to a function of the body. The applicant argued that the production of volatile sulphur compounds and halitosis as part of the bacterial flora of the mouth and oral cavity is related to the function of the mouth and oral cavity, and thus to a function of the body. However, the Authority noted that the evidence provided did not demonstrate that the chemical neutralisation of volatile sulphur compounds in the mouth, in order to improve bad breath, constitutes a physiological effect in relation to a function of the body. Therefore, the applicant did not provide evidence that zinc has a physiological effect in relation to a function of the body as required by Article 13(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.
