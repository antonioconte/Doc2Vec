The available information suggests that multi-kilogram quantities of α-PVP are imported into the Union drug market from China and then distributed across the Union. Two illicit production sites have been seized in a Member State, indicating that the capacity to manufacture α-PVP also exists within the Union.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Eight Member States have reported a total of 115 deaths and 191 acute intoxications where α-PVP was detected.
