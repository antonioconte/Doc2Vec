On the basis of that Regulation, the import of products containing milk, milk products, soya and soya products intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children originating in or consigned from China is prohibited. Furthermore, identity and physical checks, including sampling and analysis to control the presence of melamine, are carried out on approximately 20 % of consignments originating in or consigned from China of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed and of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya and soya products.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(2)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Since July 2009, only one non-compliant sample was reported by the competent authorities of the Member States.
