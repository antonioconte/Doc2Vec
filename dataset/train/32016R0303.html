These varieties cannot be considered as indigenous varieties or specific Tuscan varieties. The processing of the grain to obtain the wholegrain flour type ‘0’ that takes place in the defined geographical area is typically similar to the one that takes place everywhere in Italy and in Europe in general. Since the blending of various qualities of soft wheat is necessary to achieve the right mix suited to the intended use of the required flour, it is the flour's technical characteristics that characterise the product rather than the origin of the soft wheat. The technical characteristics of type ‘0’ soft-wheat wholegrain flour whose use is mandatory in the production of ‘Pane Toscano’, are generic and not specific to Tuscany. The application is in contradiction in point 5.2 where it is argued that the high nutritional value and digestibility of the product is due to the use of a mixture of flours, while point 3.3 had specified the use of only one specific type ‘0’ soft-wheat wholegrain flour. The application did not demonstrate the causal link between the geographical area and the quality or characteristics of the product. This is confirmed by the circumstance that the single document is obliged to refer to the ‘profound knowledge’ of the ‘bakers' craft’, seen as ‘the most important’ in a ‘context of various interacting elements’. The storage of flour at the mill for a suitable period of time to ensure the process of so-called ‘maturazione’ is not specific. This is common practice widely used throughout the European Union. The proposed name for registration ‘Pane Toscano’ is commonly used throughout Tuscany for several types of bread, which are presumably not produced according to the process defined in the application. In addition, in Italy, ‘Pane Toscano’ is deemed synonymous with bread without salt.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the follow-up of the opposition procedure, the opponents also alleged that the product specification should have included rules on the origin of the seeds, and that the influence of the temperature on the characteristics of the flours, as claimed by the applicant, is not proven by any scientific evidence.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Despite the abovementioned allegations submitted by the opponents, it is appropriate to register the name ‘Pane Toscano’ as a protected designation of origin for the following reasons.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The name to be registered refers to the product ‘bread’ and not to flour or wheat.

The wheat germ, naturally present in the flour following the milling process described in detail in the product specification, influences at the same time the nutritional value of ‘Pane Toscano’ and the raising process, the wheat germ being rich in enzymes which help break down the compound sugars. The knowledgeable use of sourdough creates the conditions for lactic-acid fermentation, resulting in compounds which, during baking, give the bread its typical aroma and flavour. In particular, the sourdough starter must interact with flours with precise characteristics set out in the product specification (low hardness, low W value and medium P/L value). Due to a significant climatic specificity, such characteristics are found in flours made with wheat varieties grown in Tuscany rather than in neighbouring areas. The non-use of salt influences the fermentation processes and it also clearly characterises the related flavour. In this context of various interacting elements, the bakers' craft and knowledge, as regards in particular the quality parameters, the preparation of the sourdough and the raising and baking phases, is of the utmost importance. Human and natural factors are deeply interlinked and combined in a dynamic structure that globally constitutes the link between the area and the qualities of the product.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Against this picture submitted by the applicant, the opponents developed an unconvincing reasoning, which is not liable to undermine the soundness of the application.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(15)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The fact that the varieties of soft wheat used to produce the product named ‘Pane Toscano’ are not specific to Tuscany and are found in other Italian and European regions is not relevant.

Several wheat varieties allowed to be used for making the flour for the ‘Pane Toscano’ have, in fact, their origin in Tuscany, but this is not the crucial issue. The product specification and the single document explain that the most important element is the impact of the environment on the wheat. While sharing the same genetic heritage, wheat varieties develop specific characteristics because of the influence of climatic conditions. The same varieties grown in other areas, even those neighbouring Tuscany, do not have the same commercial and technical parameters necessary to produce ‘Pane Toscano’. In the specific case, the Tuscan phenotypes of these wheat varieties, due to the action of climate conditions and in particular with reference to the minimal temperatures, result in flours having specific parameters (the hardness, the W value and the P/L value) that are suitable for the production of ‘Pane Toscano’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(16)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, also the observation that the technical characteristics of the soft-wheat flour required for the production of ‘Pane Toscano’, which is not wholegrain flour — as stated by the opponents — but just flour including wheat germ, are generic, proves baseless.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(17)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The definition of a protected designation of origin does not require the product to be produced via a process which is specific to the defined geographical area.
