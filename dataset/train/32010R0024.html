Therefore, on the basis of the information available, it has not been shown that the registration of ‘Jihočeská Niva’ would be liable to mislead consumers as to the true identity of the product.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">No evidence has been presented which would allow the Commission to conclude that having regard to the fair and traditional usage and the actual likelihood of confusion, registration of the name ‘Jihočeská Niva’ as a protected geographical indication would run counter to the provisions laid down in Article 7. According to the evidence presented to the Commission, the term ‘Niva’ was used in a generic way for a type of cheese, within the Czech and Slovak Republic, since tens of years. Moreover, registration of the said name as a protected geographical indication would not require the cancellation or invalidation of the trade marks, since they were applied for prior to the date of submission of the registration application to the Commission, nor hinder continued use of the same. Furthermore, according to the information available to the Commission, the exclusive right of the proprietor of the said trade marks would not entitle him to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade and in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters, an indication concerning geographical origin pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2008/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Jihočeská Niva’ should be entered in the ‘Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e186-1-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e191-1-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
