The statements of objection from Austria showed that trade marks including the term ‘Olmützer Quargel’ had been registered prior to the application for registration of the term ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ as a protected geographical indication. As the names have common origins and given the visual similarities between the products, the application of the protection envisaged by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, and in particular point (b) of paragraph 1 thereof, could have the result that ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, if registered, would be found by a competent court to be protected against the use of the name ‘Olmützer Quargel’. The evidence therefore shows that the continued existence of the name ‘Olmützer Quargel’ would be jeopardised by the registration of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, in accordance with Article 7(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. Moreover, the evidence shows that the use of the name ‘Olmützer Quargel’ referred to a product having a common origin with ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, but was generally not meant to exploit the reputation of the latter name. For these reasons, and in the interests of fairness and traditional usage, the maximum transitional period foreseen by Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 should be foreseen.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Concerning trade marks containing the term ‘Olmützer Quargel’ that were protected through registration or acquired by use prior to the application for registration of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, the conditions of Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 not being met, the said trade marks cannot be invalidated nor can their continued use be hindered by virtue of the registration of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ as a protected geographical indication, provided the general requirements under trademark legislation are otherwise met.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The prohibition on registration of names that have become generic laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 refers to the whole name proposed for registration.

Furthermore, a statement of objection pursuant to Article 7(3)(d) of the said Regulation, regarding the generic status of a name, is limited to the name for which registration is requested. While the name proposed for registration is ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ the evidence provided in the statements of objection referred to the alleged general use of the term ‘Olmützer Quargel’ in Germany and Austria, and not to that of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’.
