In order to meet this objective, the overall global annual mean surface temperature increase should not exceed 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) fourth Assessment Report shows that in order to reach that objective, global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak by 2020. At its meeting of 8-9 March 2007, the European Council made a firm commitment to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions of the Community by at least 20 % compared to 1990 levels by 2020 and by 30 % provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and economically more advanced developing countries contribute according to their respective capabilities.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(2)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In 2009, the Commission completed a review of the Union's Sustainable Development Strategy focussing on the most pressing problems for sustainable development such as transport, climate change, public health and energy conservation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Policies and measures should be implemented at Member State and Union level across all sectors of the Union economy, and not only within the industrial and energy sectors, in order to achieve the necessary emissions reductions.
