Accordingly, health claims that did not receive a favourable assessment on their scientific substantiation by the Authority, as it was not concluded that a cause and effect relationship had been established between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and the claimed effect, should not be authorised. Authorisation may also legitimately be withheld if health claims do not comply with other general and specific requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, even in the case of a favourable scientific assessment by the Authority. Health claims inconsistent with generally accepted nutrition and health principles should not be made. The Authority concluded that for one claim on the effect of fats on the normal absorption of fat soluble vitamins and another claim on the effect of sodium on the maintenance of normal muscle function a cause and effect relationship has been established. However, the use of these health claims would convey a conflicting and confusing message to consumers, because it would encourage consumption of those nutrients for which, on the basis of generally accepted scientific advice, European, national and international authorities inform the consumer that their intake should be reduced. Therefore, these two claims do not comply with point (a) of the second paragraph of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 which foresees that the use of claims shall not be ambiguous or misleading. Furthermore, even if the health claims concerned were to be authorised only under specific conditions of use and/or accompanied by additional statements or warnings, it would not be sufficient to alleviate the confusion of the consumer, and consequently the claims should not be authorised.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(13)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">This Regulation should apply six months after the date of its entry into force to enable food business operators to adapt to its requirements, including the prohibition according to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of those health claims whose evaluation by the Authority and whose consideration by the Commission has been completed.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides for the Commission to establish and maintain a Union Register of nutrition and health claims made on foods, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Register’.
