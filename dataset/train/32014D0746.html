The absence of binding action at the international level could lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in third countries where industry is not subject to comparable carbon constraints (‘carbon leakage’). To address this risk of carbon leakage, Directive 2003/87/EC provides that, subject to the outcome of the international negotiations, the Commission is to determine a list of sectors and subsectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage (‘list of sectors and subsectors’). Those sectors and subsectors should receive free allowances at 100 % of the quantity determined on the basis of Directive 2003/87/EC and Decision 2011/278/EU, subject to the cross-sectoral correction factor referred to in Article 10a(5) of Directive 2003/87/EC and set out in Annex II to Commission Decision 2013/448/EU.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In this respect, the Commission analysed the extent to which third countries representing a decisive share of global production of products in sectors and subsectors on the carbon leakage list firmly commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in those relevant sectors, and whether those commitments are comparable with those of the Union and are carried out within the same time-frame. In addition, the extent to which the efficiency of the installations located in those countries is comparable to the installations located in the Union was also examined. The Commission concluded that no sufficient comparability can be established on the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore the comparability of carbon efficiency is not relevant.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The first list of sectors and subsectors deemed to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage was established for 2013 and 2014 by Commission Decision 2010/2/EU in 2009.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The assessment should be based on a number of quantitative and qualitative criteria, and based on data from the three most recent years.

NACE-4 is the level with optimal data availability defining sectors precisely.

For sectors and greenhouse gases only covered by the EU ETS from 1 January 2013, there are no emissions data in the EUTL available.

In order to establish the first list of sectors and subsectors an assumed carbon price of EUR 30 per tonne of CO<span class="sub">2</span> equivalent was used for the assessments. In the period of application of Decision 2010/2/EU, there has been a substantial difference between the carbon price assumed for the assessments and the actual carbon price, the latter one being considerably lower. However, the Commission has in its Communication entitled ‘A policy framework for the climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030’ proposed a 40 % unconditional greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2030 as compared to 1990 and a corresponding renewable energy sources target. The Commission has also proposed to establish a market stability reserve in the EU ETS. Under those circumstances, it is expected that the carbon price will in the future be more strongly driven by mid- and long-term emission reductions. It is therefore considered justified to continue using an assumed carbon price of EUR 30 per tonne of CO<span class="sub">2</span> equivalent for the assessments underlying this Decision.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The direct and indirect additional costs should be calculated as a share of gross value added.
