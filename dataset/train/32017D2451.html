EFSA concluded that genetically modified soybean FG72 × A5547-127, as described in the application, is as safe as the non-genetically modified comparator and non-genetically modified soybean reference varieties with respect to potential effects on human and animal health and the environment in the context of its intended uses. However, the EFSA GMO Panel could not conclude on the use of forage from genetically modified soybean FG72 × A5547-127 as or in feed, as no compositional data on forage was submitted by the applicants. That use should therefore be excluded from the scope of this authorisation. Since forage is usually used where the cultivation takes place, no import is expected thereof in the Union and the exclusion of forage from the scope of the authorisation does not need to be accompanied by further measures.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Article 6(4) and Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In addition, EFSA also concluded that the monitoring plan for environmental effects, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicants, is in line with the intended uses of the products.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Taking into account those considerations, the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified soybean FG72 × A5547-127 for the uses listed in the application, with the exception of the use of forage as or in feed, should be authorised.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">A unique identifier should be assigned to genetically modified soybean FG72 × A5547-127 in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements, other than those laid down in Article 13(1) and Article 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and in Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council, appear to be necessary for the products covered by this Decision.
