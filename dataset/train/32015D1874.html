It has emerged on the illicit amphetamine market where it is sold and used as the controlled drug, amphetamine. There has been one report of the substance being detected in a commercial product sold on the internet. The main chemical precursor for the synthesis of 4-methylamphetamine is 4-methylbenzyl methyl ketone (4-methyl-BMK), which appears to be commercially available on the internet and is not controlled under the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The specific physical effects of 4-methylamphetamine have been rarely reported by users, since users are typically unaware that they have taken the substance. However, the few reports that are available suggest that it has stimulant-type effects. Limited data available relating to humans suggest that the adverse effects of 4-methylamphetamine include hyperthermia, hypertension, anorexia, nausea, perspiration, gastric distress, coughing, vomiting, headache, palpitations, insomnia, paranoia, anxiety and depression. Current data is not sufficient to determine the relative dependence-producing potential of the substance.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">According to the limited data sources available, the acute toxicity of 4-methylamphetamine is similar to that of other stimulants.
