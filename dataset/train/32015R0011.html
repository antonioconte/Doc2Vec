With regard to the alleged failure concerning use of the name of a country which was allowed in exceptional cases, ‘Kranjska’ is not the name of a country but of a (former) region. Moreover, Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 does not foresee for protected geographical indications the use of the name of a country in exceptional cases only. Concerning the allegation that the geographical area has no natural characteristics distinguishing it from neighbouring areas, there is no need to assess the substance of this allegation as this is not required by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The terms‘Krainer’, ‘Käsekrainer’, ‘Schweinskrainer’, ‘Osterkrainer’ and ‘Bauernkrainer’ on the one hand, and the terms ‘Kranjska’ and ‘Kranjska kobasica’ on the other hand were found to be the names of similar sausages in German and Croatian language respectively and have common historic origins referring to the former Land of ‘Kranjska’ which no longer exists administratively today. As the names have common origins and given the visual similarities between the products, the application of the protection envisaged by Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, and in particular point (b) of paragraph (1) thereof, could have the result that ‘Kranjska klobasa’, if registered, would prevent producers not complying with the product specification of ‘Kranjska klobasa’ from using the terms ‘Krainer’, ‘Käsekrainer’, ‘Schweinskrainer’, ‘Osterkrainer’, ‘Bauernkrainer’, ‘Kranjska’ and ‘Kranjska kobasica’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The evidence shows that the use of the terms ‘Krainer’, ‘Käsekrainer’, ‘Schweinskrainer’, ‘Osterkrainer’, ‘Bauernkrainer’, ‘Kranjska’ and ‘Kranjska kobasica’ referred to products having a common origin with ‘Kranjska klobasa’, was not meant to exploit the reputation of the latter name and that the consumer has not been or couldn't have been misled as to the true origin of the products.

The oppositions claimed that consumers in Austria, Croatia and Germany do not associate the names used on their market terms such as ‘Krainer’, ‘Krainer Wurst’, ‘Kranjska’ and ‘Kranjska kobasica’ with a particular origin. While the name proposed for registration is ‘Kranjska klobasa’, the evidence provided in the statements of opposition referred to the alleged general use of the term ‘Krainer’, ‘Krainer Wurst’, ‘Kranjska’ and ‘Kranjska kobasica’ in Austria, Croatia and Germany, and not to that of ‘Kranjska klobasa’. The oppositions do not take into consideration the situation in Slovenia. No evidence has been provided in the statements of oppositions to show general usage comprising or including the name proposed for registration. Therefore, on the basis of information provided, the name ‘Kranjska klobasa’ cannot be considered to be generic and there is accordingly no failure of compliance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(13)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Whereas protection is granted for the term ‘Kranjska klobasa’ as a whole, the non-geographical component of that term may be used, and used in translation, throughout the Union, provided the principles and rules applicable in the Union's legal order are respected.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Kranjska klobasa’ should be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(15)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Agricultural Product Quality Policy Committee,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e467-37-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The name ‘Kranjska klobasa’ (PGI) is registered.</p><p class="normal">The name in the first alinea identifies a product from class 1.2.
