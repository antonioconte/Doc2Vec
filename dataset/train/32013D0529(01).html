More precisely, when a vehicle goes uphill the electricity from the battery may be used to the maximum extent possible, thus achieving a higher degree of battery electricity utilisation compared to a vehicle with a conventional state of battery charge strategy. When the vehicle goes downhill the energy is used to charge the battery. In order to be eligible as an eco-innovation the system should be permanently active as part of the powertrain operating strategy.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission finds that the information provided in the application demonstrates that the conditions and criteria referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and in Articles 2 and 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 have been met.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Applicant has demonstrated that the market penetration in 2009 of technologies of the kind described in the application did not exceed the threshold specified in Article 2(2)(a) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011.

In order to demonstrate the CO<span class="sub">2</span> saving effect of the technology, a testing methodology has been defined that reflects both speed and road slope profiles that are characteristic of European driving patterns and itineraries. The Applicant has derived the road slope profiles from information gathered from extensive real life test tracks and road slope data from across the EU. In order to provide the required representativeness, the road slope profiles have been paired with speed profiles that are close to the NEDC speed profile. For the lower speeds there are differences, but these lead to conservative values for the CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions benefits of the innovative technology. The reference test cycle should be used for a set of roller dynamometer tests with activation and deactivation of the innovative technology. The Applicant has also calculated and demonstrated the temporal share of the technology usage in normal operation conditions (Usage Factor).
