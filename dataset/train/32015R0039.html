A name may be registered as a PGI if it is used in trade or in common language, and only in the languages which are or were historically used to describe the specific product in the defined geographical area. Consequently, as it was demonstrated that the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ is used in trade and in common language, in the language of the defined geographical area, its registration as a PGI complies with Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The name <span class="italic">Focaccia al formaggio di Recco</span> may not be used for products which do not comply with the specification for the product registered under the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Furthermore, the opposing parties also cited Article 10(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 as grounds for opposition, i.e. registration of the name proposed would jeopardise the existence of products legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of publication provided for in Article 50(2)(a) of the aforementioned Regulation.

As the processes prohibited under the specification for the proposed name fall within the prerogatives of the applicant group and the content of the specification complies with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, the fact that existing products would allegedly be jeopardised cannot per se prevent the name from being registered.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Furthermore, the Italian Government gave transitional national protection to the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ by Decree of 13 February 2012 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies.

It would be nonsensical to attribute a transitional period to the opposing parties who import the product and who are established in Portugal and the United Kingdom. In any case, trademarks which were registered or acquired through use in good faith anywhere in the Union prior to the date the application for protection of the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ was submitted to the Commission, may continue to be used and renewed irrespective of the name being registered.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The opposing parties also argued that the specification is in breach of food health standards as regards food preservation. They argue that by prohibiting pre-cooking, deep-freezing, freezing and other preservation techniques, the preservation of the product, and consequently food safety could be compromised. Furthermore, the specification is alleged to contain disproportionate and unlawful standards aiming to regulate the stages following production of the product, even to the extent of dictating how the product should be consumed after sale. In reality, the specification does not contain rules that are in breach of health standards. It is simply the case that if the prohibited preservation processes do have to be used, the product may no longer be sold under the registered name. The specification is in any case subordinate to general EU legislation. As regards the nature and objectives of the rules contained in the specification, they merely set out the characteristics that products under the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ must have when offered for consumption, which relate specifically to how the product bearing the name is produced and in no way affect how the product is consumed once it has been sold.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The opposing parties also claim that prohibiting all forms of preservation unjustifiably restricts the free circulation of a legally-produced product through a rule that is in no way connected to the protection of that product. The product can in fact circulate, albeit not using the name if the product does not comply with the specification. This consequence is justified by the objective of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, namely to protect the names of registered geographical indications.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(13)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ should be entered in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Agricultural Product Quality Policy Committee,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e244-7-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ (PGI) is hereby entered in the register.</p><p class="normal">The name referred to in the first paragraph identifies a product in Class 2.3.
