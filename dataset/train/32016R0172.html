Energy accounts aim at analysing the interactions between the environment and human action with a view to evaluate the whole environment-economy-environment cycle created by human activity. Energy accounts should, therefore, include notably the residuals arising from the final use of energy products as well as both the raw natural and the processed products.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">A definition for the energy products not covered in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 should be based on international economic environmental accounts standards, in order to ensure cost-efficiency and avoid unnecessary burden on respondents,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e111-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">For the purposes of Section 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EU) No 691/2011 Member States shall produce the physical energy flow accounts with the energy products listed in the Annex to this Regulation.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e116-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
