Each Member State should be able to define the combination or combinations of authentication elements that are to be used to develop security features that are applied to tobacco products manufactured on or imported into its territory. The combination or combinations used should include visible and invisible elements. According to international standards, invisible elements, which are not directly perceptible by human senses, may further be defined by reference to the sophistication of equipment necessary for the verification of their authenticity. In order to maximise the robustness of the features, it is appropriate to require the use of at least one invisible element the verification of which requires the use of purpose built tools or professional laboratory equipment. The inclusion of a variety of different types of authentication elements into a security feature should ensure the necessary balance between flexibility and a high level of security. This should also enable Member States to take into account new innovative solutions, capable of further bolstering the effectiveness of security features.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The combination of different authentication elements should be required as an important step in guaranteeing that the integrity of the final security feature applied to a tobacco product is well protected.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The importance of ensuring the robustness of a system for security features is recognised by internationally recognised standards.

It should therefore be required that at least one authentication element in a security feature is provided by an independent third party solution provider, thereby reducing the potential for attacks perpetrated by persons or entities that are directly or indirectly connected with the producer or originator of authentication elements used to develop the security feature. In addition, in order to ensure the continuing respect of the requirement for independence that is critical for ensuring and maintaining the integrity of security features across the Union, the procedures for monitoring compliance with the independence criteria set out in this Decision should undergo periodic review by the Commission.
