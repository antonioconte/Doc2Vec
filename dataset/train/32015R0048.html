The statement of objection relates to the possible threat to the existence of a product which was legally on the market for at least five years prior to the date of publication or to products covered by the Protected Geographical Indication ‘Aceto Balsamico di Modena’, to non-compliance with the labelling provisions of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs and to non-compliance with specific provisions concerning the marketing of the categories of grapevine products established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 [replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007].</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In a letter dated 10 June 2013, the Commission asked Spain and Italy to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with Article 51(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012. Pursuant to that Article, Spain sent by letter of 10 October 2013 its report on the end of the consultation period. In a letter dated 25 October 2013, Italy reiterated its opposition to the registration, citing reasons different to those evoked originally. Since no agreement was reached between these Member States within three months, the Commission must take a decision in accordance with Article 52(3)(b) of the said Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards the possible threat to the existence of a product which was legally on the market for at least five years prior to the date of publication or to products covered by the Protected Geographical Indication ‘Aceto Balsamico di Modena’, it appears from an examination of the documents provided by the parties that that ground for opposition has not been established.

Spain has changed the description of the product in the specification and in point 3.2 of the Single Document by distinguishing between ‘wine vinegar’ and vinegar made from ‘wine vinegar’. Consequently the use of the name 'wine vinegar' for the corresponding distinct product appears to comply with Annex VII, part II, point 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. In accordance with Article 51(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, this non-substantive amendment does not require a new examination of the application by the Commission.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards its decision to maintain its opposition, Italy claims that the registration application is contrary to Article 3(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006, as it covers two fundamentally different products that are not of the same type and that the name is not used to designate the two products, in particular the vinegar. It should be noted, firstly, that the said article [now Article 5 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 668/2014] does not preclude the registration of distinct products of the same type and, secondly, that Italy does not provide any evidence in support of its claims concerning the use of the name.
