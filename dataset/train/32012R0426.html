Pursuant to this agreement, the Specification and the Summary were amended in a minor way by adding lactic acid and citric acid to the list of authorised preservatives and by limiting at 8,5 % the sodium chloride content of the brine solution at the fermentation stage. Greece and the objectors also agreed that the registration of the name ‘Πράσινες Ελιές Χαλκιδικής’ (Prasines Elies Chalkidikis) should not prevent the placing on the market of a product, the labelling of which includes the term ‘variety Chalkidikis’, as long as the product in question comprises or is derived from this variety and that consumers are not misled, the usage of the variety name constitutes fair competition, and the usage does not exploit the reputation of the protected designation of origin. Pursuant to this agreement this would be ensured when the term ‘variety Chalkidikis’ appears on the label in smaller letters compared to those of the product name, at a reasonable distance from the sales designation of the product and provided it is accompanied with the indication of the place of origin, when this place is other than Chalkidiki.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Πράσινες Ελιές Χαλκιδικής’ (Prasines Elies Chalkidikis) should be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.
