The best available data for the calculation of the historic emissions was considered to be the comprehensive air traffic data contained in Eurocontrol's databases from the Central Route Charges Office and the Central Flow Management Unit. Those provide the actual route length for each individual flight. Emissions were then calculated on a flight-by-flight basis using the Abatement of Nuisances Caused by Air Transport 3 methodology and the Calculation of Emissions by Selective Equivalence methodology. That approach to calculating historic emissions was further enhanced through use of actual fuel consumption information provided voluntarily by a representative number of aircraft operators in order to validate the results.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The annual emissions of additional aviation activities in the calendar year 2004 from aircraft performing an aviation activity set out in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC is considered to be 114 024 tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2</span>.
