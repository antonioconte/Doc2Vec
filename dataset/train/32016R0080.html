In the opinion of the opponent, the characteristics of the product are not distinctive, since climate and soil conditions, which are a determinant element for the product's quality, are the same as in Turkey. Furthermore, the words ‘sultan’ and ‘sultaniye’ have their etymological origin in Turkey (i.e. in Anatolia). ‘Soultanina’ would, therefore, be attributable to Turkey. Besides, a product named ‘Aegean Sultana’, similar to ‘Σταφίδα Σουλτανίνα Κρήτης’ (Stafida Soultanina Kritis) is claimed to have been registered as Protected Designation of Origin in Turkey and to have become a trade mark. The presence of the term ‘Soultanina’ in the Greek name would accordingly pose a threat to the Turkish registered name, create unfair competition and mislead the consumers. The term ‘Soultanina’ is finally homonymous with a name already in the register and therefore may not be registered. The application therefore should be rejected overall.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Despite the abovementioned allegations submitted by the opponent, the PGI ‘Σταφίδα Σουλτανίνα Κρήτης’ (Stafida Soultanina Kritis) should be registered for the following reasons.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">It is not disputed that the name originates in Anatolia. However, since ‘Soultanina’ has become admittedly the name of a vine variety which is cultivated in many countries, it is no longer linked to the place of origin. It may, therefore, legally refer to a product that does not originate from Anatolia. ‘Soultanina’ was already classified as a vine variety under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3800/81, now repealed. In the currently applicable legal framework, ‘Soultanina’ was notified as a wine grape variety under Article 63(1), point (d), of Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2009.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards the specific characteristics of ‘Σταφίδα Σουλτανίνα Κρήτης’ (Stafida Soultanina Kritis) (PGI), the single document correctly and exhaustively describes the link between the specific qualities of the product and the geographical area. It is characterised by high sugar content (minimum 75 %) and low moisture content (maximum 16 %). The calcareous soils of Crete give plants that produce very good quality fruit, as it contains more sugar. The low rainfall and long hours of sunshine in July-August, when the grapes are ripening, has a favourable impact on sugar concentration. Rain during this period leads to dilution of the sugars in the grapes, which affects their quality. The hot, dry conditions and the practice of dipping the grapes in an alkaline solution before they are dried result in rapid loss of water and a simultaneous increase in sugars, so the darkening stops and the sultanas acquire their characteristic colour. <span class="italic">Izmir Commodity Exchange</span> has not given a valid reasoning to challenge these statements.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Turkey's product ‘Aegean Sultanas’ is not a PDO registered according to the EU law.
