The Commission further questioned the eligibility of a number of plants to be included in the TNP and requested additional data and/or clarifications concerning the average waste gas flow rates, conversion factors, total rated thermal input and emission limit values applied for certain plants, in particular multi-fuel firing plants and gas turbines.
