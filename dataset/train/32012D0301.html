A general ban on the import, sale and use of new products containing the covered F-gases is accompanied by derogations specified in Annex I of the Order. These derogations relate to a number of highly specific applications and, for a number of more common applications, are based on the quantity of greenhouse gases used in the respective systems, thereby exempting for instance refrigeration units, heat pumps or air conditioning units with charges between 0,15 kg and 10 kg as well as refrigeration systems for recovering heat with a charge less or equal to 50 kg. Products for ships and military use as well as the use of SF<span class="sub">6</span> in high voltage units are exempted. On 8 December 2006 the Commission decided with reference to Article 95(6) TEC (now Article 114(6) TFEU) to authorise Denmark to maintain the provisions until 31 December 2012.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Since the adoption of Decision 2007/62/EC the circumstances justifying maintaining more stringent provisions, as laid out in that decision, persist. The national rules remain part of a broader strategy put in place by Denmark in order to meet its emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol and the subsequent burden sharing agreement adopted at Union level. Under this arrangement, Denmark has undertaken to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 21 % over the 2008-2012 period compared to the base year, 1990. The notified measures are reported to have significantly contributed to the reduction of HFC emissions in Denmark. In the decisions adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community’s greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020, Denmark has undertaken to further reduce emissions by 20 % in 2020 compared to 2005 levels.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The derogations provided for in the Order, as well as the possibility to grant in very specific cases individual exemptions from the general ban, ensure the proportionality of the measure.

There is no evidence that the notified national provisions have been or will be used as a means of arbitrary discrimination between economic operators in the Union. In view of the risks for the environment resulting from the use of F-gases, the Commission confirms its assessment that the notified national provisions do not constitute a disproportionate obstacle to the functioning of the internal market in relation to the pursued objectives, in particular considering the conclusions of the recent assessment of the application, effects and adequacy of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 that further measures for the reduction of F-gas emissions are necessary to reach the agreed Union-wide greenhouse gas emission targets.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission is of the opinion that the request by Denmark, submitted on 13 February 2012, for maintaining its national legislation more stringent than Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 with respect to the placing on the market of products and equipment containing, or whose functioning relies upon, F-gases, is admissible.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Moreover, the Commission confirms its Decision 2007/62/EC that the national provisions in Order No 552 of 2 July 2002:</p> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">meet needs on grounds of the protection of the environment,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">take into account the existence and technical and economic availability of alternatives to the banned applications in Denmark,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">are likely to result in limited economic impact,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">are not a means of arbitrary discrimination,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">do not constitute a disguised restriction on trade between Member States, and</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">are thus compatible with the Treaty.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p class="normal">The Commission therefore considers that they can be approved.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission may at any moment reassess whether the conditions for the approval continue to be fulfilled.
