First, the Commission examined the eligibility of installations for free allocation, the division of installations into subinstallations and their boundaries. The Commission then analysed the application of the correct benchmark values to the relevant subinstallations. Considering that for product-benchmark subinstallations Decision 2011/278/EU lays down, in principle, for each product one benchmark, the Commission paid particular attention to the application of the benchmark value to the final product produced in accordance with the product definition and the system boundaries set out in Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU. Furthermore, given the significant impact on allocations, the Commission analysed in detail the calculation of the historical activity levels of installations, cases of significant capacity changes during the baseline period as well as cases of installations starting operation during the baseline period, the calculation of the preliminary number of emission allowances to be allocated free of charge taking into account the exchangeability of fuel and electricity, the carbon leakage status as well as heat exports to private households. Further statistical analyses and plausibility checks using indicators such as, for example, proposed allocation per historical activity level compared to benchmark values or historical activity level compared to production capacity helped in identifying additional potential irregularities in the application of the harmonised allocation rules.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On the basis of the results of that assessment, the Commission carried out a detailed assessment of installations where potential irregularities in the application of the harmonised allocation rules were identified, seeking further clarification from the competent authorities of the Member State concerned.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the results of that compliance assessment, the Commission considers the NIMs of Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom to be compatible with Directive 2003/87/EC and Decision 2011/278/EU.

In accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2003/87/EC and Decision 2011/278/EU, the preliminary amounts of free allocation to be submitted as part of the NIMs are calculated on the basis of harmonised Union-wide rules. Decision 2011/278/EU does not provide for the adjustment which Germany would wish to make on the basis of Article 9(5) of the German Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Act — TEHG of 28 July 2011. Whereas until 2012, free allocation of emission allowances was organised nationally, for the period as of 2013 the legislator intentionally established fully-harmonised rules for free allocation to installations, so that all installations are treated in the same manner. Any unilateral change to the preliminary amounts of free allocation calculated by Member States on the basis of Decision 2011/278/EU would undermine this harmonised approach. Germany has not substantiated that the allocation for the installations in question calculated on the basis of Decision 2011/278/EU was manifestly inappropriate having regard to the objective of full harmonisation of allocations to be achieved. Assigning more free allowances to some installations would distort or threaten to distort competition and has cross-border effects given Union-wide trade in all sectors covered by Directive 2003/87/EC. In the light of the principle of equal treatment of installations under the EU ETS and of Member States, the Commission finds that it is therefore appropriate to object to the preliminary amounts of free allocation to certain installations contained in the German NIMs and listed in point A of Annex I.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission finds that the NIMs proposed by Germany also contravene Decision 2011/278/EU because the application of the product benchmark for hot metal in the cases listed in point B of Annex I to this Decision is inconsistent with the relevant rules. In this regard, the Commission observes that in the German NIMs, in cases of basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking processes and where hot metal from the blast furnace is not refined to steel within the same installation, but exported for further processing, no free allocation of emission allowances is provided to the operator of the installation with the blast furnace for the production of the hot metal. Instead, the free allocation is provided to the installation where the steel refining takes place.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(13)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission notes that for the purposes of allocating emission allowances, product benchmarks have been laid down in Decision 2011/278/EU taking into account the product definitions and the complexity of the production processes that allow for verification of production data and a uniform application of the product benchmarks across the Union. For the application of the product benchmarks, installations are divided into sub-installations, a product benchmark sub-installation being defined as inputs, outputs and corresponding emissions relating to the production of a product for which a benchmark has been set in Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU. Benchmarks are thus established for products and not for processes. Accordingly, a benchmark has been developed for hot metal, with the product defined as liquid iron saturated with carbon for further processing. The fact that the system boundaries for the hot metal benchmark set out in Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU comprise the BOF cannot permit Member States to disregard that allocations should take place for the production of a given product. This consideration is corroborated by the fact that the benchmark values should cover all production-related direct emissions. However, it is the production of hot metal in the blast furnace that mainly causes emissions while the process of refining the hot metal to steel in the BOF converter is relatively low in emissions. Accordingly, the benchmark value would be much lower, if it also covered installations importing hot metal and refining it in the BOF converter to steel. Moreover, in the light of the overall scheme for allocation set up by Decision 2011/278/EU, in particular with regard to the rules on significant capacity changes, the allocation proposed by Germany cannot be regarded as consistent. The Commission therefore finds that due to the lack of a corresponding sub-installation that would allow for the determination of the allocation in accordance with Article 10 of Decision 2011/278/EU, installations importing hot metal for further processing cannot be regarded eligible for receiving free allocation on the basis of the hot metal benchmark for the amount of hot metal imported. The Commission therefore objects to the preliminary total annual amounts of free allocation proposed for the installations listed in point B of Annex I to this Decision.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">With regard to the application of the benchmark for hot metal in the NIMs as proposed by the Czech Republic, the Commission notes that the allocation to the installation listed under point C with the identifier CZ-existing-CZ-73-CZ-0134-11/M does not correspond to the value of the hot metal benchmark multiplied by the relevant product-related historical activity level as submitted in the NIMs and is therefore not in line with Article 10(2)(a) of Decision 2011/278/EU. The Commission therefore objects to the allocation to this installation unless this error is corrected. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the allocation to the installation listed under point C with the identifier CZ-existing-CZ-52-CZ-0102-05 takes account of processes that are covered by the system boundaries of the hot metal benchmark. The installation, however, does not produce, but imports hot metal. Due to the lack of production of hot metal in the installation with the identifier CZ-existing-CZ-52-CZ-0102-05, and thus a lack of a corresponding product benchmark sub-installation that would allow for the determination of the allocation in accordance with Article 10 of Decision 2011/278/EU, the proposed allocation is not consistent with the allocation rules and may give rise to double counting.

In this regard, the Commission notes that the emissions covered by the process emissions sub-installation are already covered by the product benchmark sub-installation for hot metal on the basis of which one of the installations also receives an allocation and are thus double counted. The product benchmark sub-installation for hot metal clearly covers inputs, outputs and corresponding emissions relating to the production of hot metal in the blast furnace and all related processes as set out in Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU, including slag treatment. The NIMs proposed by Germany therefore contravene Article 10(8) of Decision 2011/278/EU and the obligation to avoid double-counting of emissions because certain emissions are accounted for twice in the allocation to these installations.

In this regard, the Commission is aware of the opinion brought forward by Germany that the production of polymers, in particular S-PVC and E-PVC, and VCM is not covered by Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC. The Commission considers that polymers, including S-PVC and E-PVC, and VCM, satisfy the definition of the relevant activity (production of bulk organic chemicals) in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC. Accordingly, in close cooperation with Member States and the industry sectors concerned corresponding product benchmarks for S-PVC, E-PVC and VCM were derived as set out in Annex I to Decision 2011/278/EU.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(17)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission notes that the fact that the German list of installations is incomplete has undue effects on the allocation on the basis of the heat benchmark subinstallation for installations listed in point E of Annex I to this Decision exporting heat to installations producing bulk organic chemicals.
