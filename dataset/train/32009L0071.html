Self-assessments and accompanying peer reviews of the legislative, regulatory and organisational infrastructure should be aimed at strengthening and enhancing the national framework of Member States, whilst recognising their competencies in ensuring nuclear safety of nuclear installations on their territory. The self-assessments followed by international peer reviews are neither an inspection nor an audit, but a mutual learning mechanism that accepts different approaches to the organisation and practices of a competent regulatory authority, while considering regulatory, technical and policy issues of a Member State that contribute to ensuring a strong nuclear safety regime. The international peer reviews should be regarded as an opportunity to exchange professional experience and to share lessons learned and good practices in an open and cooperative spirit through advice by peers rather than control or judgement. Recognising a need for flexibility and appropriateness in regard to different existing systems in Member States, a Member State should be free to determine the segments of its system being subject to the specific peer review invited, with the aim of continuously improving nuclear safety.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(22)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making, Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p><p class="ti-section-1" id="d1e287-18-1">CHAPTER 1</p><p class="ti-section-2" id="L_2009172EN.01001801-d-001"> <span class="bold">OBJECTIVES, DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION</span> </p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e295-18-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><h4><b>Objectives</b></h4><p class="normal">The objectives of this Directive are:</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(a)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">to establish a Community framework in order to maintain and promote the continuous improvement of nuclear safety and its regulation;</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(b)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">to ensure that Member States shall provide for appropriate national arrangements for a high level of nuclear safety to protect workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiations from nuclear installations.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e316-18-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><h4><b>Scope</b></h4><p class="normal">1.
