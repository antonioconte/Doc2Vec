The committee noted the fact that these products have co-existed on the market for hundreds of years. It also noted that ‘Aceto Balsamico di Modena’ and ‘Aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena’ are different as regards their characteristics, customer base, usage, method of distribution, presentation and price, thereby ensuring the fair treatment of the producers in question and not misleading consumers.
