The opponent claims that the registration of ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) as a TSG would create unfair competition by making unlawful profit of the use of the name ‘Kayseri Pastırması’, a dried raw meat product similar to ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda), which is protected as a Geographical Indication in Turkey. Opponents allege that ‘Kayseri Pastırması’, has reached a clear reputation and is consumed in several EU countries. Moreover, the similarity of the words ‘pastirma — pastarma’ would create confusion in the eyes of the consumer. This risk of confusion is even greater given that the word ‘Pastarma’ has Turkish roots.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission has assessed the arguments provided in the reasoned statement of opposition and in the information provided to the Commission regarding the negotiations between the interested parties and it has concluded that the name ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) should be registered as TSG.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) has its specific characteristics and its own production methods. It is a dried raw meat product with specific physical, chemical and organoleptic properties, with the taste and aroma of mature beef without any spices and without foreign flavours. ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) results from the traditional method used in the production processes of salting, maturing and drying during which complex microbiological, physico-chemical and biochemical processes occur in the meat ingredient. During drying certain parameters are maintained: air temperature and humidity creating favourable conditions for the development of the country-specific micrococci (<span class="italic">M. varians</span>) and lactobacilli (<span class="italic">L. plantarum</span>, <span class="italic">L. casei</span>).

In addition, ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) has proven its place in the Bulgarian market as a traditional Bulgarian product, without making any sort of association with ‘Kayseri Pastırması’. It has been produced in Bulgaria since the 19th century; the composition and quality requirements were standardised for the first time on 1955 in Bulgarian State Standards. The registration of ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) as TSG may not affect the use of the name ‘Kayseri Pastırması’ on the market.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The reasons for opposition, pointed out by the Kayseri Chamber of Commerce, are related mainly to the origin and the use of the word ‘pastarma’. However, it should be clarified that Pastarma is a term used throughout the whole Balkan peninsula for dried meat products. Indeed, the product specification itself states that ‘the word ‘pastarma’ in the name ‘Pastarma govezhda’ is of Turkish origin and refers to a ‘salted and pressed dried meat’’. By applying for the registration of the name ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) as TSG, Bulgaria did not aim at reserving the use of the term ‘Пастърма (Pastarma)’ per se. In the light of the above, the protection should cover only the term ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) as a whole. The term ‘Pastarma’ should continue to be used, also in translation, throughout the European Union, provided the principles and rules applicable in the European Union's legal order are respected. The registration of ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) will accordingly neither prevent ‘Kayseri Pastırması’ from continuing to be marketed in the EU nor preclude the registration of other names including the term ‘Pastarma’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(13)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Notwithstanding the above, in order to avoid any possible risk of confusion for consumers facing comparable products that share similar names, it is appropriate that the name of the TSG ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) is accompanied by the claim ‘made following the tradition of Bulgaria’ as provided for by Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 for such cases.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) should be entered in the ‘register of traditional specialities guaranteed’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(15)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Agricultural Product Quality Policy Committee,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e362-27-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The name ‘Пастърма говежда’ (Pastarma govezhda) (TSG) is registered.</p><p class="normal">The name in the first paragraph identifies a product from Class 1.2.
