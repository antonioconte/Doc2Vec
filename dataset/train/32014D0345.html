The de-inkability shall be proven by using the “Deinking Scorecard” of the European Recovered Paper Council or equivalent test methods. Testing shall be performed on three types of paper: uncoated, coated and surface-sized paper. If a type of printing ink is only sold for one or two specific types of paper, it is sufficient to test the paper type(s) in question. The applicant shall provide a declaration that coated and laminated printed paper products are in compliance with point 3(c). Where a part of a printed paper product is easily removable (for instance a plastic cover), the recyclability test may be made without this component. The easiness of removal of the non-paper components shall be proven via a declaration of the paper collecting company, the recycling company or an equivalent organisation. Test methods shown by a competent and independent third party as giving equivalent results may also be used.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e302-64-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p></section>
