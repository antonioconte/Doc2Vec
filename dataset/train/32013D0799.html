The Commission further remarked that for plant 2 the Kingdom of Spain had used an emission limit value for SO<span class="sub">2</span> of 800 mg/Nm<span class="super">3</span> to calculate the plant’s contribution to the TNP ceiling for 2016, on the basis of the provisions of Article 5(2) of Directive 2001/80/EC, which the Commission considered not to be applicable for this purpose. The Commission also noted that for nine plants an emission limit value for NO<span class="sub">x</span> of 1 200 mg/Nm<span class="super">3</span> was used to calculate their contribution to the TNP ceiling for 2016, on the basis of Note 2 to Table C.1 in Appendix C of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU, but no information on the volatile content of the solid fuel used in these plants had been provided, which would justify the application of that Note. The Commission also requested additional information from the Kingdom of Spain about the measures foreseen for each of the plants included in the TNP in order to ensure timely compliance with the emission limit values that will be applicable from 1 July 2020. The Commission finally requested the Kingdom of Spain to provide additional data for plants firing multiple fuels or consisting of different plant types concerning the amount of fuels used, emission limit values, average waste gas flow rates and conversion factors for each of the fuels used or each of the plant types separately.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In its letter of 30 September 2013, supplemented by letter of 10 October 2013, the Kingdom of Spain replied to the questions of the Commission and provided additional data. For plant 2, the Kingdom of Spain reiterated its view that there was no need to change the SO<span class="sub">2</span> emission limit value used as it considered that Article 5(2) of Directive 2001/80/EC was applicable in this respect. For plant 5, the Kingdom of Spain continued to argue that it was entitled to use a combination of the minimum desulphurisation rate method and the emission limit value method. The Kingdom of Spain provided information concerning the volatile content of the solid fuel used in the period 2001-2010 by the nine plants for which a NO<span class="sub">x</span> emission limit value of 1 200 mg/Nm<span class="super">3</span> had been applied to calculate the 2016 ceiling, which showed that only for plants 3, 4 and 19 the average annual volatile content of the solid fuel used was below 10 % in each of the years between 2001 and 2010, while for the plants 13, 15, 17, 18, 24 and 25 the average annual level was exceeding 10 % during one or more years. The Kingdom of Spain argued that for all nine plants the average value of the volatile content over the whole reference period (2001-2010) was below the value mentioned in Note 2 to Table C.1 in Appendix C of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Based on the information received from the Spanish authorities on 30 September 2013 and 10 October 2013, the Commission noted that for multiple fuel types plants, for which emission limit values for all fuels fired have been provided, and for one plant for which emission limit value averaged for all fuels fired has been provided, it is necessary to clarify how the contributions to the total ceilings from those plants were calculated, specifying the emission limit values and the average annual waste gas flow rates used for each fuel fired in those plants.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">After the final assessment of the TNP notified by the Kingdom of Spain, as amended in accordance with the additional information and including the large combustion plants listed in Annex I to this decision, the Commission identified three main elements as not being in compliance with the applicable provisions, as follows:</p> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">in case of plant 2: the Commission considers the application of the emission limit value of 800 mg/Nm<span class="super">3</span> for SO<span class="sub">2</span> for calculating its contribution to the 2016 TNP ceiling on the basis of Article 5(2) of Directive 2001/80/EC, as that emission limit value is not referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 32(3) of Directive 2010/75/EU, as not appropriate;</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">in case of plant 5: the Commission considers the method of calculating its contribution to the TNP ceiling for SO<span class="sub">2</span>, combining the minimum desulphurisation rate approach and the emission limit value approach, as not appropriate;</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">—</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">in case of plants 13, 15, 17, 18, 24 and 25: the Commission considers the application of the emission limit value of 1 200 mg/Nm<span class="super">3</span> for NO<span class="sub">x</span> for calculating their contribution to the 2016 TNP ceiling, as the conditions to apply this emission limit value, which are set out in Note 2 of Table C1 to Appendix C of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU, are not fulfilled, as not appropriate.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In addition, the Commission identified several plants in the TNP where the information is still inconsistent and/or missing data need to be supplemented.
