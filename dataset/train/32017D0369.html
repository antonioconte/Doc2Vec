The available information suggests that bulk powders of MDMB-CHMICA are produced by chemical companies based in China.

Therefore, many individuals exposed to MDMB-CHMICA might be unaware that they are using the substance. In addition, such consumers might be unaware of the dose that they are consuming. The manufacturing process can also lead to an uneven distribution of the substance within the plant material, with the result that some products contain ‘hot pockets’ where cannabinoid is highly concentrated, increasing the risk of acute toxicity and outbreak of mass poisonings.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The available data suggests that MDMB-CHMICA is used by cannabis users, ‘psychonauts’ and those who are regularly subjected to drug-testing procedures, including those in prison.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">While there is no specific information on the possible effects of MDMB-CHMICA on the direct social environment or on society as a whole, multiple reports have indicated a possibility for violence and aggression as a consequence of its use.
