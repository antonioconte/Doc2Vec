This is usually due to missing information that is required in order for the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicles, more precisely the identification code composed of the type, variant and version of the vehicles concerned.

It is however necessary to take into account the fact that manufacturers cannot verify those values and ensure that the inclusion does not have a negative impact on the final values determined for the manufacturers concerned. Accordingly, an error margin should be applied to that calculation reflecting the individual situation of the manufacturer as described and justified in the notification of errors. More precisely, an error margin should be calculated for the average specific emissions and the average mass, since those two parameters determine the distance to the specific emissions target of each manufacturer, i.e. how close a manufacturer is to achieving its specific emission target.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(15)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The error margin should be determined as the difference between the distances to the specific emission target expressed as the average emissions subtracted from the specific emissions targets calculated including and excluding those registrations that cannot be verified by the manufacturers.
