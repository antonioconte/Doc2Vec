In the absence of any specific requirements, TCEP can thus be contained in toys in concentrations equal to or smaller than the relevant concentration established for the classification of mixtures containing it as CMRs, namely 0,5 % as from 20 July 2013 and 0,3 % as from 1 June 2015 respectively.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">TCEP was comprehensively evaluated in 2009 under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances.

In its opinion, adopted on 22 March 2012 and entitled ‘Opinion on tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) in toys’, SCHER notes that health effects (in particular kidney effects) have been observed after repeated exposure to 12 mg of TCEP/kg body weight per day. SCHER also notes that the TCEP content found by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (Danish EPA) in toys (0,5-0,6 %), as reported in the Danish EPA's ‘Survey and risk assessment of perfume and flavours in toys and childcare articles. Survey of chemical substances in consumer products’, corresponds to a risk for children, even without considering other exposures. When considering TCEP exposure from other sources than toys (e.g. air, dust), SCHER concludes that no additional exposure from toys can be considered as safe, and recommends setting the limit for TCEP in toys at the detection limit of a sufficiently sensitive analytical method.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the generic limit values of 0,5 % and 0,3 % referred to by Directive 2009/48/EC appear to be inappropriate for protecting children's health.
