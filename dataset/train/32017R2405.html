The Commission found that the conditions laid down in Articles 93 to 96, 97(1), 100, 101 and 102 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 had been met. It thus found, subject to possible opposition, that protection could be granted to the composite name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ as a whole, on the basis of its traditional usage. The Commission also considered that this registration would not prevent the use — provided the principles and rules applicable in the Union's legal order are respected — of the name of the ‘piquepoul’ grape variety or its synonyms, since this name neither contains nor consists of the name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’, nor, essentially, does it refer to the geographical element of that name, and therefore the conditions laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 100(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 are not met. The application to register the name was subsequently published in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span> .</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(2)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">No statement of opposition has been received by the Commission under Article 98 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In accordance with Article 99 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, the name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ should be protected and entered in the register referred to in Article 104 of that Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e131-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ (PDO) is hereby protected.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e140-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
