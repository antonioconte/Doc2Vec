Furthermore, in order to enable consumers to benefit rapidly from technical and scientific progress, especially in relation to innovative products, and thus to stimulate innovation the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should also be delegated to the Commission in respect of the regular updating of those specific requirements, taking into account all relevant data, including data provided by interested parties.

It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.

Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 sets out rules on information to be provided for all food, including non-prepacked food, on the presence of ingredients, such as gluten-containing ingredients, with a scientifically proven allergenic or intolerance effect in order to enable consumers, particularly those suffering from a food allergy or intolerance such as gluten-intolerant people, to make informed choices which are safe for them.
