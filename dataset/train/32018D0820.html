This exceptional situation requires the Netherlands to step up its efforts in preventing fraud in the implementation of its manure policy. While the 6th Action Programme already provides for measures aimed at reinforcing the control and inspections with a view to improving overall compliance with the rules of the Dutch manure policy, additional efforts need to be deployed to foster effective implementation and full compliance. Those efforts should include the establishment of an enhanced enforcement strategy, taking into account also the provisions of Directive 2008/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council . The strategy should be based on an independent assessment of compliance with the rules on Dutch manure policy and contain specific measures aiming at further strengthening inspections and controls and a clear methodology to establish sufficiently dissuasive penalties and sanctions. It is therefore justified to limit the duration of the derogation so that it expires on 31 December 2019 in order to enable the Netherlands to fully implement the enhanced enforcement strategy. The Netherlands may submit, in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC, a request for a new derogation for a subsequent period.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(17)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council  provides for a comprehensive, cross-border approach to water protection organised around river basin districts (RBDs), with the objective of achieving good status for European bodies of water.
