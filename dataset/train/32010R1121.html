It should be pointed out that ‘Holland’ is not the name of the Member State concerned, and that ‘Edam Holland’ is considered a traditional geographical name encompassed by Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. The requirements of Article 2(1), point b) of the said Regulation are in this connection fulfilled since the related geographical area is delimited accordingly to the link and the main elements of the product specificity. The specificity of Edam Holland is due to a combination of factors linked to the geographical area: such as the quality of milk (high fat level and protein content), amino acids originating from β-CN and γ-glutamyl peptide, prevalence of grazing on meadows, use of calf rennet, natural ripening, as well as the skills of the farmers and cheese producers.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards objections based on non compliance with Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Netherlands submitted information regarding the distinction between the product bearing the registered name ‘Noord-Hollandse Edammer’ and that for which the name ‘Edam Holland’ is applied.
