It is therefore appropriate to extend the validity of the temporary MRLs for profenofos in fresh herbs and rose petals, pending the submission of further monitoring data, and to lower the temporary MRLs for all other pesticide and product combinations, within the groups of fresh herbs and herbal infusions, to the relevant LODs.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col span="1" width="4%"/> <col span="1" width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">Taking into account the factors relevant to the matter under consideration, the appropriate modifications to the MRLs fulfil the requirements of Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col span="1" width="4%"/> <col span="1" width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">Through the World Trade Organisation, the trading partners of the Union were consulted on the new MRLs and their comments have been taken into account.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col span="1" width="4%"/> <col span="1" width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col span="1" width="4%"/> <col span="1" width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to allow for the normal marketing, processing and consumption of products, this Regulation should provide for a transitional arrangement for products which have been lawfully produced before the modification of the MRLs and for which information shows that a high level of consumer protection is maintained.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col span="1" width="4%"/> <col span="1" width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before the modified MRLs become applicable in order to permit Member States, third countries and food business operators to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the modification of the MRLs.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col span="1" width="4%"/> <col span="1" width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e135-5-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">Annexes II, III and V to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e140-5-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 as it stood before being amended by this Regulation shall continue to apply to products which were lawfully produced before 7 May 2015.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e148-5-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p><p class="normal">It shall apply from 7 May 2015.</p></section>
