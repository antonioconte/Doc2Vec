The solar roof consists of a photovoltaic (PV) panel which is installed on the vehicle roof. The photovoltaic panel converts ambient energy into electrical energy which, via a DC-DC-converter, is stored in an on-board battery. The Commission finds that the information provided in the application demonstrates that the conditions and criteria referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and in Articles 2 and 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 have been met.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Applicant has demonstrated that a battery charging solar roof system of the kind described in this application did not exceed 3 % of the new passenger cars registered in the reference year 2009.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to determine the CO<span class="sub">2</span> savings that the innovative technology will deliver when fitted to a vehicle, it is necessary to define the baseline vehicle against which the efficiency of the vehicle equipped with the innovative technology should be compared as provided for in Articles 5 and 8 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011. The Commission finds that the baseline vehicle should be a vehicle variant that in all aspects is identical to the eco-innovation vehicle with the exception of the solar roof and, where applicable, without the additional battery and other appliances needed specifically for the conversion of the solar energy into electricity and its storage. For a new version of a vehicle in which the solar roof panel is installed the baseline vehicle should be the vehicle in which the solar roof panel is disconnected and the change in mass due to the installation of the solar roof is taken into account.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Applicant has provided a methodology for testing the CO<span class="sub">2</span> reductions which includes formulae which are based on the Technical Guidelines with regard to a battery charging solar roof.
