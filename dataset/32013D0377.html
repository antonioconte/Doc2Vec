This derogation is provided by the Union to facilitate an agreement at the 38th session of the ICAO Assembly on a realistic timetable for the development of a global MBM beyond the 38th session of the ICAO Assembly and on a framework for facilitating the comprehensive application of national and regional MBMs to international aviation, pending the application of the global MBM. On this basis, with a view to facilitating the optimal interaction between any such outcome and the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union, further steps could be considered. In this respect, the Commission should, when assessing the need for further action, also take into account the possible impact on intra-European air traffic with a view to avoiding any distortions of competition.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission should provide a full report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the progress made at the 38th session of the ICAO Assembly and swiftly propose measures in line with the results, as appropriate.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">It is essential to ensure legal certainty for aircraft operators and national authorities in view of the surrender deadline of 30 April 2013 as referred to in Directive 2003/87/EC.
