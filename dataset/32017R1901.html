They also assert that the name ‘Danbo’ would not qualify as a traditional non-geographical name and that no exceptional circumstances exist that would justify the designation of the whole of Denmark as the delimited geographical area. The oppositions further claimed that the name ‘Danbo’ has become a generic name as provided for in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, replaced by Articles 6(1) and 41 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012. In this respect they pointed out that ‘Danbo’ has been subject to a Codex Alimentarius Standard since 1966 as well as it has been included in the Annex B of the Stresa Convention of 1951. The generic nature of the name would be demonstrated by the fact that ‘Danbo’ has also its own tariff line. The oppositions further indicate the importance of the production and consumption of ‘Danbo’ in several EU and non-EU countries, certain of which have a specific legal standard for it.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">By letters of 18 September 2012, in accordance with Article 7(5) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Commission invited the interested parties to engage in appropriate consultations.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Given that no agreement was reached within the designated timeframe, the Commission should adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 52(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Concerning the alleged failure of the name ‘Danbo’ to comply with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, replaced by Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, it should be noted that the relevant provision in force does not distinguish a country as an exceptional case for a geographical indication. Likewise, appreciation whether or not ‘Danbo’ is a ‘traditional non-geographical name’ is not any more required. The registration of ‘Danbo’ as a PGI is actually applied for on the basis of its reputation that is attributable to its geographical origin within the meaning of Article 5(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 and which is extensively described in the published single document and in the product specification.

However, having a specific Codex Alimentarius Standard as well as an inclusion of ‘Danbo’ in Annex B to the Stresa Convention does not imply that the said name has become <span class="italic">ipso facto</span> generic. As indicated by the Court of Justice in its standing case law, tariff codes relate to customs issues and are therefore not relevant to the intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the limited data that were submitted concerning, in particular, the production of ‘Danbo’ outside the European Union are not relevant considering the principle of territoriality inherent to Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, according to which the possibly generic nature of a name is to be assessed in relation to the territory of the EU. The perception of this term outside the European Union and the possible existence of related regulatory production standards in third countries are not deemed relevant to the present decision.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">No evidence has been provided in the opposition procedure as regards imports of such cheese from third countries to the European Union.
