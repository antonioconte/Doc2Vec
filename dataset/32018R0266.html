While the mixture of herbs called ‘Herbes de Provence’ contains typical Provençal herbs, it also contains other spices such as bay and nutmeg which are not typical of Provence. In addition, ‘Herbes de Provence’ is made with herbs which do not necessarily originate from Provence. The registration of the name ‘Thym de Provence’ therefore might jeopardise the marketing of the entire mixture of herbs and spices as ‘Herbes de Provence’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Finding such opposition admissible, by letter dated 1 August 2017, the Commission invited France and Germany to engage in appropriate consultations for a period of three months to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">An agreement was reached between the parties.
