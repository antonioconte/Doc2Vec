Therefore it reiterated its previous conclusions that MON 863 maize is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed uses. In its opinion EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Article 6(4) and Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">By Commission Decisions 2010/139/EU, 2010/140/EU and 2010/141/EU, the placing on the market of food and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863×MON810×NK603 maize, MON863×MON810 maize and MON863×NK603 maize is authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, until 1 March 2020.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On 29 June 2015, Monsanto Europe S.A. asked the Commission to put an end to all the authorisations granted by the Commission to products containing, consisting or produced from genetically modified maize MON 863, as single event and in stacked events, following a commercial decision of the company not to market these products anymore in the EU.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As a consequence, Monsanto Europe S.A. withdrew the application for the renewal of the authorisation for continued marketing of existing food additives, feed materials and feed additives produced from MON 863 maize submitted on 13 April 2007 for which EFSA published an opinion on 30 March 2010 and asked the European Commission to repeal Decisions 2005/608/EC, 2006/68/EC, 2010/139/EU, 2010/140/EU and 2010/141/EU.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As MON 863, as single event or in stacked events, has not been commercially cultivated since 2011 in third countries and the commercial phase out is completed, it is not necessary to provide for a limited period of time within which existing stocks of the product may be used up.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Decisions 2005/608/EC and 2006/68/EC expire on 12 January 2016.
