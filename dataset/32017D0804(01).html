Although the name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ contains the term ‘Picpoul’, which is the name of a wine grape variety, it is established that the name has been traditionally used in the territory of the Member State at issue because the application for registration follows the removal of the old name ‘Languedoc Picpoul-de-Pinet’ from the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications. Consequently, the name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ constitutes a protected designation of origin within the meaning of Article 93(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. The possible registration of the designation of origin ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ as requested will not prevent the use of the name of the ‘Picpoul’ wine grape variety in the labelling of wines produced from the ‘Picpoul’ grape variety but not according to the specifications of ‘Picpoul de Pinet’, because the provisions laid down by Article 100(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 are not met.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order to allow for the submission of statements of objection in accordance with Article 98 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, the single document referred to in Article 94(1)(d) of that Regulation and the publication reference of the specification made during the national procedure for examining the application for protection of the name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ should therefore be published in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e184-4-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Sole Article</p><p class="normal">The single document established in accordance with Article 94(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the reference to the publication of the product specification for the name ‘Picpoul de Pinet’ (PDO) are contained in the Annex to this Decision.</p><p class="normal">In accordance with Article 98 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, the publication of this Decision shall confer the right to object to the protection of the name specified in the first paragraph of this Article within two months from the date of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
