Further, it was clarified that most DHA is provided to breastfed infants via breast milk in which the DHA concentration is dependent both on maternal DHA dietary intake and on maternal DHA stores.

Accordingly, as risk managers could not establish specific conditions of use in accordance with Article 16(4) of the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and given that the lack of such specific conditions of use means that the beneficial effect of the product could not be assured, which amounts to misleading the consumer, this health claim should not be included in the lists of permitted health claims.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(20)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The comments from the applicants and the members of the public received by the Commission pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.
