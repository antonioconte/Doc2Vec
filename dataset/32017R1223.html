During the national objection procedure, one operator lodged an objection concerning the 50 % minimum share of coarse green fodder in the dairy cows' basic ration for at least 150 days per year. Furthermore, four operators lodged an objection concerning the farmers' 75 % minimum share of dairy cows from the Abondance, Montbéliarde or Tarentaise breeds on their farms. The reason given was that time was needed for their holdings to be adapted. Those operators have legally marketed ‘Tomme de Savoie’ continuously for at least the 5 years prior to lodging the application. The transitional period ending 31 December 2017 applies to Le Seysselan GAEC, Vallod, 74910 SEYSSEL and the transitional period ending 31 October 2025 applies to La Ferme de Combette EARL, Les Airelles GAEC, La Ferme des 3 Quartiers EARL and La Ferme de la Ville GAEC.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Since the amendments in question are not minor within the meaning of Article 53(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, the Commission published the amendment application in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span> as required by Article 50(2)(a) of that Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As no statement of opposition under Article 51 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 has been received by the Commission, the amendments to the specification should be approved,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e158-14-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The amendments to the specification published in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span> regarding the name ‘Tomme de Savoie’ (PGI) are hereby approved.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e170-14-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">The protection provided under Article 1 is subject to the transitional period granted by France pursuant to the Order of 29 October 2015 on the protected geographical indication ‘Tomme de Savoie’, published on 7 November 2015 in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the French Republic</span> under Article 15(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, to operators meeting the conditions of that Article.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e188-14-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
