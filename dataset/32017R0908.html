During the national objection procedure, two operators lodged an objection concerning the obligation to use raw milk in the production of ‘Picodon’, indicating that they were unable to immediately comply with that provision and that a period of time was needed to adapt their production tools. These operators, which have also legally marketed ‘Picodon’ continuously for at least the five years prior to the lodging of the application, meet the conditions of Article 15(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012. A transitional period ending on 31 December 2016 has therefore been granted to them in this context. The operators in question are: Fromagerie du Vivarais, Les Pélissons, 07570 Désaignes; Eurial, rue Henri Barbusse, 26400 Crest.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Since the amendments in question are not minor within the meaning of Article 53(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, the Commission published the amendment application in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>  as required by Article 50(2)(a) of that Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As no statement of opposition under Article 51 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 has been received by the Commission, the amendments to the specification should be approved,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e165-23-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The amendments to the specification published in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span> regarding the name ‘Picodon’ (PDO) are hereby approved.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e177-23-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">The protection provided under Article 1 is subject to the transitional period granted by France pursuant to the Order of 17 February 2016 on the protected designation of origin ‘Picodon’, published on 26 February 2016 in the Official Journal of the French Republic under Article 15(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, to operators meeting the conditions of that Article.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e192-23-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
