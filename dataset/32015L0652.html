The calculation method should ensure accuracy, while having due regard for the complexity of the associated administrative requirements. At the same time, it should incentivise suppliers to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel they supply. Careful consideration should also be given to the impact of the calculation method on refineries in the Union. Hence, the calculation method should be based on average greenhouse gas intensities that represent an industry average value which is typical for a particular fuel. This would have the advantage of reducing the administrative burden on suppliers and Member States. At this stage, the proposed calculation method should not require differentiation of the greenhouse gas intensity of fuel on the basis of the source of the raw material, as this would affect current investments in certain refineries in the Union.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(2)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Reporting requirements for suppliers which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC should be minimised as far as possible in the context of Article 7a(1) of Directive 98/70/EC.
