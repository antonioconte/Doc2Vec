The increased sustainable use of harvested wood products can substantially limit emissions into and enhance removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

In that regard, this Decision should provide for the use of specific methodologies in respect of different LULUCF activities. Emissions and removals relating to afforestation, reforestation and deforestation are the result of direct human-induced conversion of land and should therefore be accounted for in their entirety. Emissions and removals relating to grazing land management, cropland management, revegetation and wetland drainage and rewetting are all accounted for by applying a base year to calculate changes in emissions and removals. However, emissions and removals from forest management depend on a number of natural circumstances, age-class structure, as well as past and present management practices. The use of a base year does not make it possible to reflect those factors and resulting cyclical impacts on emissions and removals or their interannual variation. The relevant accounting rules for calculating changes in emissions and removals should instead provide for the use of reference levels to exclude the effects of natural and country-specific characteristics. Reference levels constitute estimates of the annual net emissions or removals resulting from forest management within the territory of a Member State for the years included in each accounting period, and should be set transparently in accordance with Decisions 2/CMP.6 and 2/CMP.7. The reference levels referred to in this Decision should be identical to those approved through the UNFCCC processes. If improvements to methodologies or data relating to the establishment of the reference level become available to a Member State, the Member State should carry out the appropriate technical corrections to include the impact of recalculations in the accounting for forest management.</p> <p class="normal">The accounting rules should provide for an upper limit applicable to net removals for forest management that may be entered into accounts.
