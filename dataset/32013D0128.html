The Commission identified certain relevant information as missing in the original application and requested the Applicant to complete it. The Applicant provided the required information on 25 October 2012.

The Commission notes that although other, more energy efficient, lighting technologies may have been in use within a limited segment of the car fleet, it is acknowledged that halogen lighting had the highest market penetration for the fleet as a whole. As a consequence, and for the purpose of ensuring that the testing methodology may be relevant and representative for the vehicle fleet as a whole, it is appropriate to consider halogen lighting as baseline technology.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Applicant has provided a methodology for testing the CO<span class="sub">2</span> reductions from the use of the LEDs in the lighting functions concerned.
