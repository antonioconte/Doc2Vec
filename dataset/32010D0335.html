Those Guidelines were intended for national greenhouse gas inventories and are not expressed in a form that is readily applicable by economic operators. It is therefore appropriate, where IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories lack the necessary information for purposes of biofuel and bioliquid production or where such information is not accessible, to draw on other scientific sources of data.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">For the calculation of the carbon stocks in soil organic matter it is appropriate to take into account climate, soil type, land cover, land management and input. For mineral soils, the IPCC Tier 1 methodology for soil organic carbon is an appropriate method to use for this purpose as it covers the global level. For organic soils, the IPCC methodology addresses in particular carbon loss following soil drainage and does this only through annual losses. As soil drainage normally results in high carbon stock loss that cannot be compensated by the greenhouse gas saving of biofuels or bioliquids and as drainage of peatland soil is prohibited by the sustainability criteria laid down by Directive 2009/28/EC, it suffices to lay down general rules for determining soil organic carbon or carbon losses in organic soils.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">For the calculation of carbon stock in living biomass and dead organic matter a low complexity approach corresponding to IPCC Tier 1 methodology for vegetation should be an appropriate method. In accordance with that methodology it is reasonable to assume that all carbon stock in living biomass and dead organic matter is lost from the land upon conversion. Dead organic matter is usually of low significance in land conversion for the establishment of crops for the production of biofuels and bioliquids, but should be taken into account at least for closed forests.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In calculating the greenhouse gas impact of land conversion, economic operators should be able to use actual values for the carbon stocks associated with the reference land use and the land use after conversion.
