EFSA also stated that the use of milk and milk products from a flock with classical scrapie may carry a TSE exposure risk for humans and animals. It also concluded that the breeding programmes for scrapie resistance in sheep can be expected to reduce human and animal exposure associated with small ruminants dairy products. As regards the atypical scrapie, it further concluded that the apparent restricted dissemination of the agent in the organism of affected individuals could limit the transmissibility through milk. As regards BSE, it noted that no information is available concerning the presence of infectivity or PrP<span class="super">Sc</span> in colostrum or milk from small ruminants affected with BSE. However, because of the early and progressive peripheral dissemination of the BSE agent in experimentally infected susceptible sheep, it concluded that the occurrence of infectivity in colostrum and milk of BSE infected susceptible small ruminants would be likely.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On 6 November 2008, the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) published an Opinion on the risk of classical scrapie spreading via the milk of small ruminant animals where it reached the same conclusions as regard the transmissibility of classical scrapie from ewe to lamb via milk or colostrums as the EFSA Opinion.
