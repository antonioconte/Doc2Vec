According to the Annex XV dossier, there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health due to the respiratory sensitising properties of TMA, which give rise to an equivalent level of concern to those of other substances listed in points (a) to (e) of Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(2)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On 15 December 2016, the Member State Committee of the Agency (MSC) adopted its opinion on the Annex XV dossier. While a majority of the MSC members considered that TMA meets the conditions for identification as a substance of very high concern in accordance with Article 57(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the MSC did not reach a unanimous agreement. Three members abstained. Three members were of the opinion that there is not sufficient scientific evidence of TMA's probable serious effects to human health which give rise to an equivalent level of concern to those of other substances listed in points (a) to (e) of Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Those three members expressed doubts about the type, severity, irreversibility, delay of health effects of TMA, the social concerns linked to its effects and the impossibility to derive a safe level of exposure to TMA.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On 17 January 2017, pursuant to Article 59(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the Agency referred the MSC opinion to the Commission for a decision on the identification of TMA on the basis of Article 57 (f) of that Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission notes, in line with the majority opinion of the MSC, that the data presented and discussed in the Annex XV dossier show that TMA causes serious and permanent impairment of lung functions, if the exposure is prolonged and no intervention takes place. The cases of adverse effects reported vary from occupational rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma to severe diseases, such as pulmonary disease-anaemia syndrome, allergic laryngitis and allergic alveolitis. Some of the effects have been so severe that subjects were forced to leave their jobs. The most severe effects can require long medical treatment.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(5)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission notes that, while certain effects of TMA are reversible upon cessation of exposure, the first stage of sensitisation (induction) is irreversible. In addition, from the available data on humans, it is not possible to derive a concentration level of TMA below which sensitisation does not happen. Furthermore, it seems that severe effects have some latency time. The possibility of irreversible effects occurring before a health problem is identified has been recognised in the identification of other substances of very high concern in accordance with Article 57(f) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 because of their respiratory sensitising properties, and confirmed by European case-law.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission notes that workers that have been sensitised previously can only be relocated to tasks with zero exposure to TMA, to avoid the recurrence of the severe adverse effects, causing societal concerns and effects on quality of life of sensitised workers.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission therefore considers, in line with the majority opinion of the MSC, that the level of concern posed by TMA is equivalent to that of substances referred to in points (a) to (e) of Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and, hence, that TMA should be identified as a substance of very high concern according to Article 57(f) of that Regulation due to its respiratory sensitising properties.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e183-16-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">1.
