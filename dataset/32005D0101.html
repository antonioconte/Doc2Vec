[…] Only in that way, moreover, is it possible to realise the objective, in the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of the Directive, of maintaining or restoring the natural habitat types and the species' habitats concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range, which may lie across one or more frontiers inside the Community’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">On the basis of available information and on the common assessments made within the framework of the biogeographic seminars, prepared by the European Topic Centre on Nature Protection and Biodiversity, and the bilateral meetings held with the Member States, some Member States have not proposed sufficient sites to meet the requirements in Directive 92/43/EEC for certain habitat types and species. It can therefore not be concluded for these species and habitat types listed in Annex 2 to this Decision that the network is complete. However, taking into account the delay in receiving the information and reaching agreement with the Member States, the Commission considers that it should adopt an initial list of sites which will need to be revised in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC for the habitat types and species listed in Annex 2 to this Decision for which indicated Member States have not proposed sufficient sites according to the requirements of Directive 92/43/EEC.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Given that knowledge on the existence and distribution of the natural habitat types of Annex I and species of Annex II to that Directive that occur in both marine territorial waters and as well as marine waters under national jurisdiction beyond territorial waters remains incomplete, it cannot be concluded that the network is either complete or incomplete for them.
