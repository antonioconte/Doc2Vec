Several methods and protocols to carry out the risk assessment are already in existence and are used and respected within the scientific community in the area of biological invasions. The value and scientific robustness of such methods and protocols should be recognised. In the interest of efficiently using existing knowledge, any method or protocol which includes the common elements should be accepted for the preparation of the risk assessment. However, in order to ensure that all decisions on listing species are based on risk assessments of similar high quality and robustness and to provide guidance to the risk assessors on how the ensure that the common elements are appropriately considered, it is necessary to set out a detailed description of the common elements, as well as a methodology to be applied in the risk assessment to which the existing methods and protocol should adhere.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order for the risk assessment to help underpin decision-making at the Union level, it should be of relevance to the Union as a whole, excluding the outermost regions (‘the risk assessment area’).</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In order for the risk assessment to provide a robust scientific basis and solid evidence to underpin decision-making, all information in it, including in relation to the ability of a species to establish and spread in the environment as per Article 4(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014, should be supported by the best available scientific evidence.
