Therefore, and in view of available statistical information, the calculation of the weight of EEE placed on the market should be based on data on domestic production of EEE in the Member State concerned as well as on data on imports of EEE into that Member State coming either from other Member States or from third countries and on exports of EEE leaving that Member State to either another Member State or a third country. Data should be obtained using Eurostat's database (Eurobase) where, in particular, domestic production of EEE is registered under the Community Production system (with PRODCOM codes). Those codes are also connected with the codes in trade statistics (the Combined Nomenclature codes). Statistics on the trade of goods measure the quantity of goods traded between Member States (intra-Union trade) and goods traded between Member States and third countries (extra-Union trade).</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(6)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">National data on domestic production of EEE, imports and exports is reported under the Community Production system, using PRODCOM codes and not under the EEE categories set out in Annexes I and III to Directive 2012/19/EU.

A WEEE calculation tool based on this methodology should be made available for use by Member States and pre-populated with the necessary data to allow its direct application.
