However, this does not necessarily compromise the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product and the appraisal of the beneficial effect exerted up to that point in time. In exceptional cases, post-authorisation studies should be imposed where a potential lack of efficacy in the long term could raise concerns with respect to the maintenance of a positive benefit-risk balance of the intervention.
