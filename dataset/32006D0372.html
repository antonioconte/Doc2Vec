Secondly, they note that the number of diesel cars has risen in the Netherlands due to higher petrol prices, the wider availability of diesel car models, and the greatly improved performance and fuel efficiency of diesel engines. Such an increase in the share of diesel cars was not expected when Directive 98/69/EC was adopted. The share of diesel cars has risen from up from below 15 % in 1995 to around 25 % now.

This is the reason why, as already mentioned, the Euro 5 proposal has recently been made. According to the proposal the emission limits for particulate matter from new diesel passenger cars and the smallest light-duty vehicles will be reduced by 80 %. In establishing the Euro 5 proposal, the Commission attempted to strike a balance between the need for further improvements in environmental performance and the need to provide car manufacturers with the necessary time to design vehicles and plan production activities. This consideration is reflected in particular in the provisions on the entry into force of the regulation. By bringing forward the application of the particulate matter emission limits set out in the Euro 5 proposal, the measure notified by the Dutch authorities would dramatically reduce the proposed lead time for implementation. This would have a significant impact on vehicle manufacturers, by obliging them to adapt their production to the requirements of the Dutch legislation or requiring them to restrict the models offered in the Dutch market. It should be noted in this regard that, at present, not all types of vehicles in the categories M<span class="sub">1</span> and N<span class="sub">1</span>, class I, are available with a particulate filter. The Dutch authorities have informed the Commission that several types of diesel passenger cars with diesel particulate filter are already available or will soon be available in the Dutch market. However the Commission notes that, on the basis of the information available to the Commission (as of December 2005), there are at least 240 different types of passenger cars out of ca. 710 that are not available in the Dutch market with a particulate filter and that therefore would be excluded from that market if the notified measure were adopted. As for some models it is the bigger engines that are equipped with particulate filters, the Dutch measure could risk excluding the smaller, more fuel efficient engines of those models from the Dutch market which would run counter to the EU’s established policy of limiting CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(51)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Dutch authorities have informed the Commission that the envisaged measure is part of a package of measures (Budget Day Set of Measures) aimed at improving air quality in the Netherlands.

It includes, among other measures, subsidies for particulate filter on new and older diesel cars, incentives for clean local traffic, freight transport and shipping, incentives for clean fuels. Research has also begun into the cost effectiveness of a subsidy for scrapping older (diesel) cars. In addition, the package of measures includes other generic traffic measures and measures covering industry and agriculture. Local measures affecting the national infrastructure will also be taken, such as reductions in the maximum speed on certain roads. Finally, the package of measures also seeks to take action at local level, such as through the implementation of municipal air quality plans, additional money to encourage less polluting local transport in municipalities and provinces and a measure based on reimbursing a substantial proportion of the additional costs of low-pollution technologies such as particulate traps.

The ‘hard measures’ are concrete actions that have already been specified, their financing has been arranged and they fall under the competence of the Central Government.

These figures are based on the fact that at the moment of the notification the proportion of diesel vehicles with a particulate trap was 10 % of all cars and on the assumption that the Euro 5 regulation will be mandatory as of 1 July 2008 at the earliest for new types of vehicles and as of 1 January 2010 for new vehicles.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(55)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Commission acknowledges that the Dutch authorities have implemented since 1 June 2005 a fiscal incentive scheme for fitting new diesel cars with particulate filters. The Commission notes that in the document ‘Assessment of the Budget Day Set of Measures tackling air quality 2005’ (Beoordeling van het prinsjesdagpakket — Aanpak Luchtkwaliteit 2005), the Dutch authorities assess the impact of this incentive scheme. They assume that, as a result of this measure and assuming that the Euro 5 standard will enter into force at the earliest on 1 July 2008 for new types of vehicles and on 1 January 2010 for new vehicles, in 2008 70-90 % of the new diesel cars sold in the Netherlands will have a particulate filter. The corresponding figures for the previous years are 40-60 % for 2006 and 60-80 % for 2007. The Commission therefore concludes that the additional benefits of the introduction of the notified provisions, in comparison with a baseline scenario where the incentive scheme for new diesel cars is in force, and taking into account the autonomous trend in Europe of equipping diesel vehicles with particulate filters, would be considerably lower than the estimated benefits of 0,4 to 0,5 kt reduction in particulate matter in 2010. The Commission estimates that the impact would possibly be in the range of 0,05 kt. It should also be noted that the impact of the existing fiscal incentives scheme could be further enhanced by combining this measure with other complementary measures, such as selective circulation bans in accordance with Community law in defined areas for diesel vehicles not complying with a certain particulate matter emission level. The experience of other Member States shows that often the announcement of such selective bans is sufficient to influence purchase decisions in favour of a diesel vehicle with a particulate filter or a non-diesel vehicle.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(56)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Dutch authorities consider that no other national measure with a lower impact on trade would have the same result as the notified measure.

In particular, they consider that the most cost-effective way to lower the concentrations on a Dutch scale, both regional and local, would be an additional pricing policy for the transport sector. The total benefits to society associated with this option would outweigh the costs. According to the estimations made by the Dutch authorities, varying the car taxes and the introduction of road pricing would reduce the emissions in 2010 by approximately as much as the measures proposed under the Budget Day Set of Measures.

Moreover, other social problems such as noise nuisance, poor traffic safety and congestion would also be reduced with the implementation of road pricing.

The effectiveness of this measure would be enhanced by its combination with the existing fiscal incentives scheme and could be further enhanced, as mentioned above, if other complementary measures, such as circulation bans for older more polluting vehicles, were implemented by local authorities.

For example, retrofitting of diesel vehicles with particulate filter could lead to higher emission reductions than those estimated by the Dutch authorities, if the budget allocated to this measure was increased and if particulate filters were installed in particular in vehicles with a high urban mileage (e.g. taxis). The costs of retrofitting ships with diesel particulate filters are estimated by the Dutch authorities to be lower than other retrofitting measures (in a range of EUR 10 to EUR 60 per kg of particulate matter reduction) and would be lower than the health costs associated with particulate matter concentrations, as calculated by the Dutch authorities (i.e. EUR 340 per kg in urban environment and EUR 80 per kg in rural environment). It should be noted in this regard that, according to the projections from the RAINS models, while the relative importance of particulate emissions from light-duty vehicles will decrease in the next years, the importance of the emissions from inland shipping and maritime transport is going to increase.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(60)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The Dutch authorities could also consider an earlier implementation of some of the ‘soft measures’ included in the Budget Day measures falling under the competence of the Dutch government.

In particular, according to the estimation from the Dutch authorities, the introduction of combined ‘air washing systems’ in intensive stock farming would yield a particulate matter reduction in 2010 of 4.4 kt. This reduction is considerably higher than the expected particulate matter reduction which would be generated by the implementation of the notified measure (0,05 kt, see section 55 above). This measure would probably have a bigger effect on less populated areas than in the cities.
