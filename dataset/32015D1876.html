It appears to be a stimulant substance that may also have hallucinogenic effects. 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole has been found mostly in powder form but also in tablet and capsule form. It is commercially available on the internet and from ‘head shops’, marketed as a ‘research chemical’. It has also been detected in samples of a product sold as a ‘legal high’ called ‘Benzo Fury’, and in tablets resembling ecstasy.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The existing information and data suggest that the acute toxicity of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole can provoke adverse effects in humans, such as tachycardia and hyperthermia, and may also cause mydriasis, agitation and tremor. 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole may interact with other substances, including medical products and stimulants that act on the monoaminergic system. The specific physical effects of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole in humans are difficult to determine because there are no published studies assessing its acute and chronic toxicity, its psychological and behavioural effects, or dependence potential, and because of the limited information and data available.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(4)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">There have been a total of 24 fatalities registered in four Member States from April to August 2012, in relation to which 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole alone, or in combination with other substances, was detected in post-mortem samples. While it is not possible to determine with certainty the role of 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole in all of the fatalities, in some cases it has been specifically noted in the cause of death. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the implications for individual and public health could be significant.
