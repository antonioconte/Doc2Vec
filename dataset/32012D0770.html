On the basis of that confirmation, the Commission is to determine whether manufacturers and pools have complied with the requirements of Article 4 of that Regulation. Where it is clear that a manufacturer or a pool has failed to meet its specific emissions target, the Commission is required, from 2013 onwards, pursuant to Article 9(1) of that Regulation, to issue excess emissions premiums by way of individual decisions addressed to the manufacturers or pool managers concerned.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(2)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, the targets are binding on manufacturers and pools with effect from 2012.

As the targets for 2010 and 2011 will serve as indicators to manufacturers of the effort required to reach the mandatory target in 2012, it is appropriate to determine the average specific emissions of manufacturers for 2010 and 2011 in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 4 of that Regulation and take into account only the 65 % lowest emitting vehicles of each manufacturer.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(3)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The data to be used for the calculation of the average specific emissions and the specific emissions targets is set out in Part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and is based on Member States’ registrations of new passenger cars during the preceding calendar year.
