Although the application was submitted to the Commission when Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 was into force, it was then published under Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 and, therefore, in the absence of specific transitional provisions, the latter Regulation applies. In accordance with Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 a name is eligible for TSG if it has been traditionally used to refer to the specific product or if it identifies the traditional or specific character of the product. In this case, the name ‘Suikerstroop’ has been used for centuries to define this specific product. It identifies the specific character of the product, being a syrup made with the liquid left behind during the production of sugar from sugar beet or sugar cane.

In addition, the product covered by the product specification of the name ‘Suikerstroop’ complies with the requirements set out in Article 18(1) points (a) and (b) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 since the mode of production corresponds to traditional practice for this product and the ingredients are those traditionally used.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(19)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The sentence in point 3.1 of the product specification ‘Once the procedure under Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 has been completed, it is intended that the words “traditional Dutch product” will appear on the label in the language of the country in which the product is marketed’ does not comply with Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012.
