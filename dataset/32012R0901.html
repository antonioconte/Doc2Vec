However, no obvious error related to these elements was identified by the Commission.

Nevertheless, no evidence was provided that consumers would be liable to be misled as to the true identity of a product marketed under the name ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’. Therefore, the Commission cannot conclude that the registration of the name ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’ would be contrary to Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">This trade mark may continue to be used in spite of the registration of the term ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’ as a PGI, unless grounds for its invalidity or revocation occur under trade mark law.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In addition, it should be noted that the term ‘Steirisches Kürbiskernöl’ is also a PGI registered through Commission Regulation (EC) No 1263/96. The names ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’ and ‘Steirisches Kürbiskernöl’, in their respective original languages, are clearly different, so allowing to conclude that these names are not homonymous; therefore, the existence of the name ‘Steirisches Kürbiskernöl’ would not be jeopardised by the registration of ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’ within the meaning of point (c) of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(10)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Since no agreement has been reached, the Commission should take a decision in line with the third subparagraph of Article 7(5) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. The denomination ‘Steierisches Kürbiskernöl’ has been registered before the term ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’. Article 13(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 protects the denomination ‘Steirisches Kürbiskernöl’ against use in translations. The term ‘Štajersko’ is deemed a literal translation of the geographical term ‘Steirisches’. Furthermore, when translated into third languages, the two denominations may be very similar. While there is no reason not to register the term ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’, it is necessary to protect existing prior rights and ensure fair usage. Therefore, the geographical components of the designation ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’ should not be translated into other languages when marketing the product corresponding to the specification for ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’. This would thus apply both for use of such translation on the label as well as in presentations or advertising of the product. Furthermore, with respect to labels, the country of origin should be indicated in the same field of vision as the term ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’, in letters of the same size as those used for that term.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, the name ‘Štajersko prekmursko bučno olje’ should be entered in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e260-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">The designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e265-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">References to the regions of Štajerska and Prekmurje shall not be translated when marketing products conforming to the specification of the designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation.</p><p class="normal">Labels containing the designation contained in the Annex to this Regulation shall indicate the country of origin in the same field of vision, in letters of the same size as those of the designation.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e272-3-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
