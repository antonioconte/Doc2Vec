As the Authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship is not established between the consumption of LGG® MAX and the claimed effect the claim does not comply with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and therefore the transition period foreseen in Article 28(5) is not applicable. A transition period of six months should be provided for, to enable food business operators to adapt to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. The health claim ‘Clinically tested as of 14 days. Your silhouette is apparently and globally redrawn, resculpted and refined at 28 days’ is a health claim as referred to Article 13(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and therefore subject to the transition measure laid down in Article 28(6) of that Regulation. However, as the application was not made before 19 January 2008, the requirement provided for in Article 28(6)(b) is not fulfilled, and the transition period laid down in that Article is not applicable. Accordingly, a transition period of six months should be provided for, to enable food business operators to adapt to the requirements of this Commission Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(11)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><p class="normal">HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e187-13-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 1</p><p class="normal">Health claims set out in the Annex to this Regulation may not be made on food on the Community market.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e192-13-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 2</p><p class="normal">Health claims set out in the Annex to this Regulation may continue to be used for six months after the entry into force of this Regulation.</p></section> <section><p class="ti-art" id="d1e197-13-1" style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Article 3</p><p class="normal">This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the <span class="italic">Official Journal of the European Union</span>.</p></section>
