Taking that into account, this Regulation should provide protection from the possible adverse effects of hazardous materials on board all ships calling at a port or anchorage of a Member State while ensuring compliance with the provisions applicable to those materials under international law. In order to ensure the monitoring of compliance with the requirements relating to hazardous materials under this Regulation, Member States should apply national provisions to implement Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Currently, port State control inspectors are tasked with the inspection of certification and with active testing for hazardous materials, including asbestos, under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (‘SOLAS’).

The competitiveness of safe and environmentally sound recycling and treatment of ships in ship recycling facilities located in a Member State would thereby also be increased. The establishment of a European List of ship recycling facilities (‘the European List’) fulfilling the requirements set out in this Regulation would contribute to those objectives as well as to better enforcement by facilitating the control of ships going for recycling by the Member State whose flag the ship is flying. Those requirements for ship recycling facilities should be based on the requirements of the Hong Kong Convention. In this regard, ship recycling facilities approved in accordance with this Regulation should meet the necessary requirements to ensure protection of the environment, the health and safety of workers and the environmentally sound management of the waste recovered from recycled ships. For ship recycling facilities located in a third country, the requirements should achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment that is broadly equivalent to that in the Union.
