Within this context it should offer co-financing opportunities for projects with clear environmental and climate benefits in order to ensure synergies between the LIFE Programme and Horizon 2020. Coordination is required to prevent double funding. The Commission should take steps to prevent overlap and additional administrative burden on project beneficiaries arising from reporting obligations from different financial instruments. To ensure clarity and the practical feasibility of integrated projects under the LIFE Programme, potential arrangements for cooperation should be laid down at an early stage.

The experience of past LIFE programmes has also highlighted the importance of ensuring the effective dissemination of project results and networking activities to increase the leverage effect and Union added value of the LIFE Programme, in particular through the organisation of seminars, workshops and other activities aiming at the exchange of experience, knowledge and good practices within the Union. The Commission should therefore continue and strengthen targeted dissemination activities, including those with a specific focus on integrated projects, in particular in Member States with low project uptake, and in relation to specific sectors, and facilitate the cooperation and exchange of experiences between LIFE beneficiaries and others. The Commission should also continue to regularly publish the list of projects financed through the LIFE Programme, including a short description of objectives and results achieved and a summary of the funds committed using appropriate media and technologies.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(38)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">With a view to simplifying the LIFE Programme and reducing the administrative burden for applicants and beneficiaries, more use should be made of flat rates and lump sums without compromising the eligibility of VAT and of permanent staff costs under the conditions laid down by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012. As per current practice, the sum of the public organisations' (as coordinating beneficiary and/or associated beneficiary) contributions to the project should exceed by at least 2 % the sum of the salary costs of the personnel of national administrations charged to the project. Union funds should not be used to subsidise national budgets, for example, to cover VAT costs. However, only limited information is available on the amounts of Union funds used to cover VAT.

The Commission should also propose a method for monitoring the long-term success of projects, in particular in the priority area Nature and Biodiversity. In order to provide evidence of the co-benefits that both sub-programmes can bring to climate action and biodiversity, and to provide information on the level of spending, the monitoring of the LIFE Programme should track climate-related expenditure and biodiversity-related expenditure, as defined in "A Budget for Europe 2020". Such tracking should be based on a simple methodology by placing the expenditure in one of three categories: climate/biodiversity-related expenditure only (to be counted as 100 %), significantly climate/biodiversity-related expenditure (to be counted as 40 %), and not climate/biodiversity-related expenditure (to be counted as 0 %).
