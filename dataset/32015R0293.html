Cheese bearing the name ‘Liliput’ has been lawfully produced and marketed in Poland since 1971. In company standards, technical instructions and norms for the use of raw materials ‘Liliput’ cheese is listed among other types of cheese such as Gouda, Edam and Emmental. This term, referred to the Polish cheese, is popular among Polish consumers and it is in no way linked to the Lithuanian cheese. It is therefore to be considered as a generic term for generic cheese in Poland. As regards the product, Polish ‘Liliput’ cheese has characteristics, appearance, and dimensions similar to Lithuanian ‘Liliputas’ cheese. In the end, the opponent suggests, ‘Liliput’ and ‘Liliputas’ are similar products bearing generic names. Therefore, the registration of the name ‘Liliputas’ as Protected Geographical Indication would prevent the Polish producers from marketing their ‘Liliput’ cheese or, in any event, from using the name ‘Liliput’ for a cheese.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The opponent claims also that the product and the name to be registered do not comply with the requirements of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012. As stated in the published Single Document the cheese got the name ‘Liliputas’ because of its size. Therefore, the name ‘Liliputas’ does not indicate that the product comes from a particular place but, as the Polish cheese ‘Liliput’, just refers to the small size of the cheese. In addition, the qualities of the product are not attributable to its geographical origin but they simply derive from the fact of maturing in small rounds. The impact of the local microscopic mould <span class="italic">Penicillium pallidum</span> Smith on the organoleptic characteristics of ‘Liliputas’ is not proven. Furthermore, the fact that the product was produced under State Standards in USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) would confirm that it could be produced anywhere in USSR and that there was no specific link with the delimited geographical area.

At present, in Lithuania, the name ‘Liliputas’ is indisputably associated with the hand-made semi-hard fermented high quality cheese produced in Belvederis village. Lithuanian consumers do not link that name to a Polish cheese or to standard industrialised cheese production. Therefore, although deprived of a geographical part, the name Liliputas complies with the definition of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 which states that protected geographical indication is a name identifying a product originating in a specific place, region or country.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(12)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above, ‘Liliputas’ cannot be considered a generic name. Generic names are names that, although having an historical link to the place where the product they refer to was originally produced or marketed, are now totally disconnected from such initial geographical origin. For ‘Liliputas’ it is exactly the contrary. It was originally disconnected from its geographical origin but now it is strongly linked to its area of production.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(13)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The product has qualities and reputation that are attributable to its geographical origin. Although the published single document states that the cheese got the name ‘Liliputas’ because of its size, it however clarifies that it gets its specific flavour and aroma from maturing in small rounds by means of internal microflora and the microscopic mould <span class="italic">Penicillium pallidum</span> Smith, which grows in cellars in the geographical area. This mould, which is specific of cellars in Belvederis village, is responsible of the lactic acid, fresh flavour and aroma that is distinctive to ‘Liliputas’ cheese. The area provides special conditions for this mould to survive. In addition, the fact that the cheese is hand-made and produced in a non-mechanical way contributes to the maintaining and the development of the mould. Furthermore, ‘Liliputas’ has a well-documented and solid reputation as being the flagship of the Lithuanian dairy production, which has been precisely described in the published single document.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(14)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The differences among ‘Liliputas’ and ‘Liliput’ are therefore quite evident. ‘Liliputas’ cannot be considered as a generic product.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(15)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">As regards the allegation that, since it was covered by USSR standards, ‘Liliputas’ could be produced anywhere in USSR, it should be noted that the inclusion of products in such standards was compulsory at that time.

As the names are close and given the visual similarities between the products, the application of the protection envisaged by Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 could have the result that ‘Liliputas’, if registered, would prevent Polish cheese producers from using the term ‘Liliput’.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(17)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The evidence shows that the use of the term ‘Liliput’ was not meant to exploit the reputation of ‘Liliputas’ name.
