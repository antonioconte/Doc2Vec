Such heat pumps might also be installed in parallel to an existing heating system. In such situations, the installed capacity reflects the cooling demand rather than the supplied heating. As the installed capacity is used as an indicator of heating demand in these guidelines, it implies that the statistics of installed capacity will over-estimate the amount of heating supplied.
