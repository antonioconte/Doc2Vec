In addition, Decision 16/CMP.1 provides for Parties' possibility to exceed those limits by compensating net emissions (‘debits’) resulting from the activities of afforestation, reforestation and deforestation pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Kyoto Protocol by net removals (‘credits’) resulting from forest management activities pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Kyoto Protocol.

The exclusion of the compensation rule from the accounting rules set out in the Durban Decision has an impact on the fulfilment of Parties' commitments under the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
