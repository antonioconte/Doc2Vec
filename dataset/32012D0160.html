A general methodology for assessment of chemical safety of toys with a focus on elements’, exposure of children to chemicals in toys may not exceed a certain level, called ‘tolerable daily intake’. Since children are exposed to chemicals via other sources than toys, only a percentage of the tolerable daily intake should be allocated to toys. The Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE) recommended in its 2004 report that a maximum of 10 % of the tolerable daily intake may be allocated to toys. However, for particularly toxic substances (for example arsenic, lead, mercury) the Legislator decided that the recommended allocation should not exceed 5 % of the tolerable daily intake, in order to ensure that only traces that are compatible with good manufacturing practice will be present. In order to obtain limit values, the maximum percentage of the tolerable daily intake should be multiplied by the weight of a child, estimated at 7,5 kg, and divided by the quantity of toy material ingested, estimated by the RIVM at 8 mg per day for scraped-off toy material, 100 mg for brittle toy material and 400 mg for liquid or sticky toy material. Those ingestion limits were supported by the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) in its opinion entitled ‘Risks from organic CMR substances in toys’ adopted on 18 May 2010.

However, calculations made for the purpose of this transformation were approximate. The tolerable daily intakes used are based on recommendations from 1985.

The exposure to lead can cause damage to a child’s central nervous system, thus adversely impacting his/her development. Lead exposure mainly arises from food products (cereals, vegetables and tap water being the major contributors to lead exposure). Another important exposure source is the environment, in particular house dust. An additional exposure source is the contact with consumer products, including toys. Given the high exposure from food and environment, limit values for lead in toys were set out in such way that exposure from toys does not exceed a certain amount of all exposure sources. Lead may be found in toys paints and softened plastic. Children are exposed to lead through ingestion, in particular through hand-to-mouth or mouthing behaviour. As paint deteriorates, it peels, pulverises and then can be ingested or remains on the hands and fingers from where it can be ingested or inhaled.

However, this requirement can not be interpreted as prohibiting the approval of all measures likely to affect the functioning of the internal market. All measures derogating from a harmonisation measure constitute a measure that is likely to affect the functioning of the internal market. Thus, the Commission considers that the concept of obstacle to the functioning of the internal market as referred to in Article 114(6) has to be understood as a disproportionate effect in relation to the pursued objective, in order to preserve the useful character of the procedure.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(90)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Since the measures related to mercury, arsenic and antimony are not justified by the need to protect the human health, the Commission does not have to verify whether this condition is satisfied.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(91)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">With regard to lead and barium, the Commission notes that manufacturers, when applying the provisions of the Directive, will be able to market toys in all Member States, except for Germany. Manufacturers are not likely to develop two sets of different toys, but align on the derogating provisions in order to have toys which can be marketed in all Member States. The Commission further notes that the German limits for lead and barium are those that have been applicable in the EU since 1990 on the basis of Directive 88/378/EEC, and therefore can be technically met by manufacturers. Toy manufacturers have confirmed this assumption when expressing their position on the German measures. The Commission has therefore reasons to consider that the effect on the functioning of the internal market is proportionate in relation to the objective of protecting children’s health.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(92)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">With regard to nitrosamines and nitrosatable substances, the Commission concludes similarly. The German measures on nitrosamines and nitrosatable substances are applicable in Germany since 2008. Manufacturers did not, to the Commission’s knowledge, develop two sets of different toys, but aligned to the German provisions in order to have toys which can be marketed in all Member States. With the entry into application of the Directive, less strict that the German measures, the Commission expects manufacturers to align on the strictest provisions in order to have toys which can be marketed in all Member States. The Commission further notes that meeting the German limits is technically feasible, as manufacturers comply with them since 2008. The Commission has therefore reasons to consider that the effect on the functioning of the internal market is proportionate in relation to the objective of protecting children’s health.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(93)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In the light of the above considerations, the Commission concludes that the national provisions notified by Germany with regard to mercury, arsenic and antimony are not justified on grounds of major need of protection of human health.
