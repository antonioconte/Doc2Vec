The current authorisation of nitrites as food additives makes a balance between these effects, taking into account the scientific opinion of the Authority and the need to maintain certain traditional foods on the market. For some traditionally manufactured meat products maximum residual limits were set out in Annex III to Directive 95/2/EC. Those limits should be maintained in adequately specified and identified products; however it should be clarified that the limits apply at the end of the production process. In addition, the Commission will consult Member States, the stakeholders and the Authority to discuss the possibility to reduce the current maximum limits in all meat products and to further simplify the rules for the traditionally manufactured products. Depending on the outcome of such consultation, the Commission will consider whether it is appropriate to propose an adaptation to the maximum levels of nitrites that may be added to certain meat products.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">For prepared table water covered by category 14.1.1, the only permitted additives should be phosphoric acid and phosphates.
