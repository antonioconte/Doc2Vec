Its responsibilities also arise in the context of examining applicants’ compliance with certain minimum requirements for admission to bid, in the submission and processing of applications for admission to bid and with regard to decisions to grant or refuse to grant admission to bid, to revoke or to suspend admissions to bid already granted. Under the cooperation model between ICE and its exchange members and their clients, ICE’s exchange members and some of their clients will perform such admission functions with respect to their existing or prospective clients. Such cooperation model can be compatible with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010, provided that ICE ensures that compliance with the obligations incumbent upon the auction platform under Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(7)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Furthermore, in accordance with point (b) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010, an appointed auction platform is required to provide full, fair and equitable access to bid in the auctions for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and access to bid in the auctions for small emitters. To ensure this, ICE should provide such SMEs and small emitters with transparent, comprehensive and up-to-date information, on access possibilities to auctions conducted by ICE for the United Kingdom including all necessary practical guidance on how to make the most of such possibilities. Such information should be publicly available on ICE’s webpage. In addition, ICE should report to the auction monitor appointed as provided for in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 on the coverage obtained under its cooperation model with exchange members and their clients, including on the level of geographic coverage obtained and take the utmost account of the auction monitor’s recommendations in this regard so as to ensure fulfilment of its obligations under Article 35(3)(a) and (b) of that Regulation.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(8)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In accordance with point (e) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010, when appointing an auction platform, Member States must take into account the extent to which a candidate aution platform is able to avoid distortions of competition in the internal market including the carbon market. In particular, an auction platform should not be able to use the contract appointing it to leverage the competitiveness of its other activities, notably the secondary market it organises. In addition, the listing of ICE as an auction platform should be conditional upon ICE, including any exchange members or clearing members admitted by ICE, providing the option to candidate bidders to be admitted to bid in the auctions without being required to become an exchange member or a participant in the secondary market organised by ICE or of any other trading place operated by ICE or by any third party.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(9)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">In accordance with point (h) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010, when appointing an auction platform, the Member States have to take into account the extent to which adequate measures are provided to require an auction platform to hand over all tangible and intangible assets necessary for the conduct of the auctions by an auction platform’s successor.
