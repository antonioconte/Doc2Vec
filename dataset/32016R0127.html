Follow-on formula is, on the contrary, a food intended for use by infants when appropriate complementary feeding is introduced and which constitutes the principal liquid element in a progressively diversified diet of such infants. For that reason, and in order to ensure comparisons with other foods that can be included in the diet of such infants, the expression of nutrition information for follow-on formula as a percentage of daily reference intake values should be allowed. Given that healthy infants have different nutritional needs than adults, the use of daily reference intake values set out for the general adult population in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 would mislead consumers and should therefore not be allowed.

This is due, in particular, to the possibility, recognised by that Directive, to make a health claim on infant formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates describing the role of such formula in reducing the risk of developing allergy to milk proteins, under certain conditions laid down in that Directive. In its opinion on the essential composition of infant and follow-on formulae, the Authority noted that the safety and suitability of each specific formula containing protein hydrolysates has to be established by clinical evaluation and that only one formula containing partially hydrolysed whey protein has been positively evaluated so far. The Authority also noted that clinical studies are necessary to demonstrate if and to what extent a particular formula reduces the risk of developing short and long-term clinical manifestations of allergy in at-risk-infants who are not breast-fed. Taking into account the Authority's opinion, infant formula and follow-on formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates should only be allowed to be placed on the market if their composition corresponds to the requirements of this Regulation. Those requirements may be updated in order to allow the placing on the market of formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates with a composition different from the one already positively assessed, following a case-by-case evaluation of their safety and suitability by the Authority. In addition, after the assessment by the Authority, on the basis of studies, where it is demonstrated that a specific formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates reduces the risk of developing allergy to milk proteins, further consideration will be given to how to adequately inform parents and caregivers about that property of the product.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(22)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 provides that the labelling, presentation and advertising of infant formula and follow-on formula is to be designed so as not to discourage breastfeeding.

The conclusions adopted by the Council on nutrition and physical activity invited Member States to promote and support adequate breastfeeding and welcomed the Member States' agreement on an EU Action Plan on Childhood Obesity 2014-2020, which includes a series of actions aimed at increasing breastfeeding rates in the Union. In this context, the EU Action Plan recognised the continuous importance of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, on which Directive 2006/141/EC was based. The WHO Code, adopted by the 34th World Health Assembly, aims at contributing to the provision of safe and adequate nutrition for infants, by the protection and promotion of breast-feeding, and by ensuring the proper use of breast-milk substitutes.
