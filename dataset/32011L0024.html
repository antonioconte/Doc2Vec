Therefore, Member States should also ensure that these values are respected with regard to patients and citizens from other Member States, and that all patients are treated equitably on the basis of their healthcare needs rather than on the basis of their Member State of affiliation. In doing so, Member States should respect the principles of free movement of persons within the internal market, non-discrimination, inter alia, with regard to nationality and necessity and proportionality of any restrictions on free movement. However, nothing in this Directive should oblige healthcare providers to accept for planned treatment patients from other Member States or to prioritise them to the detriment of other patients, for instance by increasing the waiting time for treatment of other patients. Inflows of patients may create a demand exceeding the capacities existing in a Member State for a given treatment. In such exceptional cases, the Member State should retain the possibility to remedy the situation on the grounds of public health, in accordance with Articles 52 and 62 TFEU.

However, in certain circumstances patients may seek some forms of healthcare in another Member State. Examples include highly specialised care or healthcare provided in frontier areas where the nearest appropriate facility is on the other side of the border. Furthermore, some patients wish to be treated abroad in order to be close to their family members who are residing in another Member State, or in order to have access to a different method of treatment than that provided in the Member State of affiliation or because they believe that they will receive better quality healthcare in another Member State.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(40)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">According to the constant case-law of the Court of Justice, Member States may make the assumption of costs by the national system of hospital care provided in another Member State subject to prior authorisation. The Court of Justice has judged that this requirement is both necessary and reasonable, since the number of hospitals, their geographical distribution, the way in which they are organised and the facilities with which they are equipped, and even the nature of the medical services which they are able to offer, are all matters for which planning, generally designed to satisfy various needs, must be possible. The Court of Justice has found that such planning seeks to ensure that there is sufficient and permanent access to a balanced range of high-quality hospital treatment in the Member State concerned. In addition, it assists in meeting a desire to control costs and to prevent, as far as possible, any wastage of financial, technical and human resources. According to the Court of Justice, such wastage would be all the more damaging because it is generally recognised that the hospital care sector generates considerable costs and must satisfy increasing needs, while the financial resources made available for healthcare are not unlimited, whatever mode of funding is applied.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(41)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">The same reasoning applies to healthcare not provided in a hospital but subjected to similar planning needs in the Member State of treatment.

In light of technological progress, the development of new methods of treatment and the different policies of the Member States regarding the roles of hospitals in their healthcare systems, the question of whether this kind of healthcare is delivered within hospital or ambulatory care facilities is not the decisive factor for deciding whether it requires planning or not.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(42)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Given that the Member States are responsible for laying down rules as regards the management, requirements, quality and safety standards and organisation and delivery of healthcare and that the planning necessities differ from one Member State to another, it should therefore be for the Member States to decide whether there is a need to introduce a system of prior authorisation, and if so, to identify the healthcare requiring prior authorisation in the context of their system in accordance with the criteria defined by this Directive and in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice.

The Court of Justice has identified several potential considerations: the risk of seriously undermining the financial balance of a social security system, the objective of maintaining on grounds of public health a balanced medical and hospital service open to all and the objective of maintaining treatment capacity or medical competence on national territory, essential for the public health, and even the survival of the population. It is also important to take into consideration the general principle of ensuring the safety of the patient, in a sector well known for information asymmetry, when managing a prior authorisation system. Conversely, the refusal to grant prior authorisation may not be based on the ground that there are waiting lists on national territory intended to enable the supply of hospital care to be planned and managed on the basis of predetermined general clinical priorities, without carrying out an objective medical assessment.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(44)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">According to the constant case-law of the Court of Justice, the criteria for granting or refusing prior authorisation should be limited to what is necessary and proportionate in the light of these overriding reasons in the general interest.

It should therefore be for Member States to set such criteria for refusing prior authorisation that are necessary and proportionate in that specific context, also taking into account which healthcare falls within the scope of the prior authorisation system, since certain treatments of a highly specialised nature will be more easily affected even by a limited patient outflow than others. Consequently, Member States should be able to set up different criteria for different regions or other relevant administrative levels for the organisation of healthcare, or indeed for different treatments, as long as the system is transparent and easily accessible and the criteria are made public in advance.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(45)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Where the patient is entitled to healthcare and that healthcare cannot be provided within a time limit which is medically justifiable, the Member State of affiliation should in principle be obliged to grant prior authorisation.

In that event, Articles 7 and 8 of this Directive should not apply. This is in line with the case-law of the Court of Justice which has specified that patients who were refused prior authorisation on grounds that were subsequently held to be unfounded, are entitled to have the cost of the treatment obtained in another Member State reimbursed in full according to the provisions of the legislation in the Member State of treatment.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <col width="4%"/> <col width="96%"/> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">(47)</p> </td> <td valign="top"> <p class="normal">Procedures regarding cross-border healthcare established by the Member States should give patients guarantees of objectivity, non-discrimination and transparency, in such a way as to ensure that decisions by national authorities are made in a timely manner and with due care and regard for both those overall principles and the individual circumstances of each case.
